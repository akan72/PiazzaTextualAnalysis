Anyone has any ideas? Thanks a lot!  I thought I submitted to grade scope my code style assignment, however, it did not seem to fully upload it ( i did it around 11:58). When I went to check it, it seems that I cannot submit it again. Is there a way I can submit my assignment? I committed my changes to Github 12 hours ago, so I did not do anything after the deadline, so do I get points of???  I am currently trying to submit my CodeStyle assignment to GradeScope about an hour and a half after the deadline, but the tab for the assignment is not allowing me to even click into it for submission. I don&#39;t remember hearing/seeing anything about late submissions not being accepted and so am assuming this is a mix-up.       On another note, I ended up deciding to stay up and put more time into the assignment to give it more thought and complete it as thoroughly as I felt possible. With this being said, I was wondering if the &#34;7/10 and up&#34; rule still applies to assignments turned in after the deadline after the &#34;late-penalty&#34; up to that point has been applied. By this I mean that, because I only turned in the assignment an hour and a half late on the same night, if my score after being graded and having the late penalty applied to it still is above a 70%, would it be possible to still receive full credit? Otherwise, it could have been better for me just to have turned it in by the deadline without giving it as much thought.       Thanks so much.  For the order of the methods, should we worry about having them in the same order to match up with the interface?  If a method can be turned into a default method in the interface, should we change it as such or just leave it?  For some reason in my code when my program creates hand it passes the array of cards to new PokerHandImpl but for some reason hand is null.   So when I&#39;m debugging and I step over the line:   PokerHand hand =  new  PokerHandImpl(cards);   when:   Card[] cards = { two_of_hearts ,  three_of_hearts ,  four_of_hearts ,  five_of_hearts ,  six_of_hearts };   hand equals null even though none of the cards in the cards array are null. Could I get some help?  What&#39;s the best way to get a uniform background color in TicTacToe? I&#39;ve tried a bunch of things and I am stuck.  After I imported A7 into Eclipse, this error message shows up on ExampleGame.java:             And I tried to run ExampleGame.java, the console shows this error message:          So far I have tried to reimport the entire A7 as well as deleted the JRE System Library from building path and added it again under the Modulepath. How can I fix this problem?           Which will be considered better code style?    if (cardsInHand[i].getSuit() != cardsInHand[0].getSuit()) { \t\t\t\treturn false; \t\t\t}   or    if (cardsInHand[i].getSuit() != cardsInHand[0].getSuit()) return false;   or    it doesnt matter     In CardImpl there&#39;s a String[] called strings, in strings[0] and strings[1] there are null values. I tried removing these and saw that they didn&#39;t affect the jUnit tests but I was wondering if it&#39;s bad code style to have these null values in? I&#39;m not sure if I should leave it as is or if I should take them out.  For the CodeStyle assignment, I understand we need to be changing things such as method names and variables to be more accurate as well as adding comments to make code more readable. However, I don&#39;t fully understand how much we should edit the way the method code is written if we should at all.  Thanks!  There appears to be a difference between the content of the code and what is expected from the JUnit tests. For example the JUnit tests expect to receive the original deck of cards from getCards but instead gets a clone. Should this be fixed in the actual code or should this be ignored even though the JUnit tests fail?  are we allowed to import java.util.Arrays? or should we do everything without extra libraries?  I had a question about the example game. In the main method, the parameter is a string[], but I don&#39;t understand why. Could someone please explain this?  Are we allowed to remove unnecessary   helper   methods such as isTheWheel() in PokerHandImpl? Or should we just fix existing methods? And can I add an extra field to easily get rid of multiple lines of code?  Should we add comments for the getters, or are those obvious enough that we don&#39;t need to?  What is the purpose of setting num = 0 if num &lt; 0 in the find_pair_starting_at(int num) method in PokerHandImpl?     Do we need to write a comment for every method or just for methods we think is important?   Thanks!  I&#39;ve never played poker so I&#39;m not sure about this.      What does card_array in PokerHandImpl represent? I know it&#39;s an instance field for 5 card objects in an array but what does it represent in the game?  What is the variable named cidx in DeckImpl? I&#39;m not sure what the findAndRemove() method is in the deck. Can someone please tell me what it is doing? If we changed method names in the class, should we change the method names in the JUnit tests?  In the code style guide, it never specifically mentioned return statements. I was just wondering if it is necessary to change the original return statement of :   return ((pairIndex != -1) &amp;&amp;   noOtherPairs);      to   if(noOtherPairs &amp;&amp;   pairIndex != -1) {  return true;   }  return false;  What is the hasHand method in DeckImpl supposed to do? I didn&#39;t see anything about it on the write up so I don&#39;t know how to fix/comment on it.      Update - got it!  Does it matter what type of exception we throw throughout the methods if a variable is null or doesn&#39;t match the criteria? I&#39;m still not sure on when to use Runtime vs. IllegalArgument, etc.  I only changed the variable names but my junit test keeps stopping at &#34;two_pair_hand.compareTo(full_house_hand)&#34;.  I remember during recitation the other day, Katherine mentioned that we should pay attention to where methods return a variable instead of a value like true/false, ints, etc. If I&#39;m right, she mentioned that we should return the value and not be returning a variable for any return statements. I think there&#39;s one specific method that doesn&#39;t do this and we&#39;re supposed to fix it.      Just confirming if this is true and if it&#39;s being looked at for Code Style?     Do we need to pay attention to code styles for A7 currently and A8 in the future? I have some questions on codestyle assignment.  - Are we expected to style/comment the JUnit tests or just the assignment files? - Is it ok to make methods in the interface public explicitly? Or, should we leave it as defaults? Do we touch/comment on Deck and DeckImpl at all? It&#39;s not mentioned on the Github ReadMe file, so I&#39;d assume we can ignore it (besides maybe fixing some formatting and translating changed variable names)?  Should we comment method descriptions in the interface, the implementations, or both? Also, do constructors need comments (to explain exception tests,etc.)?      For boolean contains(Card c).. are we expected to follow the Github guidelines of using &#34;c&#34; as our name, or should we follow the regular guidelines and use a non-single character name such as &#34;card&#34;?  Is it possible that we have some more final practice exams(like finals in fall18 or spring19)? I found it really helpful to finish every midterm practice exams and would like to do the same in final again. Thanks!  In the interface, class, or both? If we do both is that over-commenting?  Just wonder when will our midterm grades be finalized? Thanks!  Do we get to resubmit the code style assignment if we don&#39;t get full credit the first time it is graded? Is the code style assignment due by 6 am on Sunday (meaning we don&#39;t have Sunday to work on it) ?   In recitation, we were told not to under-comment our code and at the same time not to over-comment our code. I wanted to ask to what extent we would comment the following function:   \tpublic boolean isOnePair() {  \t\tint pair_idx = findFirstPair(0);  \t\tboolean no_other_pairs = findFirstPair(pair_idx&#43;1) == -1; \t\t \t\treturn ((pair_idx != -1) &amp;&amp; no_other_pairs); \t\t \t}      What I currently have is pasted below, is that too much?      \t/* Implementation of isOnePair() method \t * Output: true if current poker hand is one pair \t *         false if current poker hand is not one pair \t */\t \tpublic boolean isOnePair() { \t\t//Find the index of the first pair in our hand \t\tint pair_idx = findFirstPair(0); \t\t \t\t//See if there are any other pairs in our hand \t\tboolean no_other_pairs = findFirstPair(pair_idx&#43;1) == -1; \t\t \t\t//Only return true if we found exactly one pair, false otherwise \t\treturn ((pair_idx != -1) &amp;&amp; no_other_pairs); \t}     Thank you! There’s talk in the CS department and the College of arts and sciences that the department will have to LIMIT the number of CS majors in order to accommodate the growing number of students in the major. This policy may not affect you, but it will affect our future and current undergraduate classmates, especially those in underrepresented communities. If we want to support growth in our CS community, we feel the college should add faculty instead of having an admission policy that limits student opportunities.   At the very least, we should show up tonight at the workshop tonight 5-6:30 in SN0014 to share our opinions with the faculty and Director of Undergraduate Studies (regardless of whether you agree with us or not).  Please make your voices heard tonite! Does this mean that the late penalty when we turn in our assignment will be proportionate to 50% divided by approx. 1 month rather than 50% divided by 3 days?   Thanks for the extension btw  Is there any chance we could get an extension of the late submission?  Hello. I&#39;m struggling to understand what the last three tests I&#39;m failing from the A6 autograder might be looking for:    Adept Test:  reallyFarAwayTest  Jedi Test:  unevenJediTest  Jedi Test:  onePoolStartsEmpty       As for reallyFarAwayTest, I edited the junit test posted here a few days ago so that one of the the Manhattan distances between the furthest driver&#39;s vehicle and the client&#39;s position was the value Integer.MAX_VALUE and others were very large numbers and passed it fine (albeit it taking about a minute and fifteen seconds to run the test). It didn&#39;t say I had an infinite loop in the autograder, just that I failed it.       For unevenJediTest, the junit test posted here actually started with unevenly sized pools and I passed that fine, but I also edited it so that there were some different combinations of uneven pools just in case and passed those as well.      For onePoolStarts empty, I again edited the posted junit test so that this time, one of the pools was passed into the constructor as an element of the list parameter was empty (not null, but an arrayList made from an empty array) and passed the test.      I&#39;m honestly pretty stuck on how to go about debugging it at this point, as my code is passing all of the other tests in the autograder and my own attempts at trying to resolve these three remaining one&#39;s seem are pointing me towards any issues in handling the specific cases they&#39;re named after. I would really appreciate some insight on how to move forward. Thanks!       (Also: I&#39;m pretty sure these exact tests have already been posted about, but I&#39;m not certain that a solution has been discovered as to what specifically they might be testing, so I wanted to go ahead and make another post.)  Does anyone know what a ConcurrentModificationException is?   I always return a few names followed by this error when when running the &#34;Eddie Ennion&#34; test code, yet it passes the test fully when I run the &#34;B&#34;,&#34;O&#34;,&#34;B&#34; drivers test code.   I believe my code may be getting stuck in an eternal while loop I haven&#39;t figured out yet, because I failed every single Jedi test on Gradescope yet still passed a JUnit... it&#39;s quite confusing.      Has anyone else experienced a similar problem/same results?  I feel that the 50% rule is a little unfair. I wasn’t passing 4 of the adept tests because I had a &lt;= somewhere when I should have had a &lt; and that created an endless loop that I did not notice That was my only issue with adept so if the autograder had been available before the due date I would have caught that problem and I would have had 20 more points instead of 10 more.       Is there any way that we could get full points for something small like that because I worked really hard on A6 and one tiny little mistake keeps me at a 75 instead of an 85.  I feel like our grade shouldn&#39;t suffer because the grader wasn&#39;t set up by the due date.  How late after the A6 deadline can we submit for half points?  I cannot pass these tests, but my code runs properly, returns the right values in the right order, terminates once it is done, etc.       Does anyone know what could be the problem? I&#39;m out of ideas and hope.   Make sure that if you find a driver within the ring that you update everything appropriately if that driver was the last in the pool before returning true  For CodeStyle, do we have unlimited submissions?  I accidentally submitted when trying to submit A6 and I doubt that I will get any credit.  For code style, we&#39;re supposed to replace the generic method names (i.e. r(), s()) with the ones in the directions, right? Because when I change the method name, I have to change the JUnit test. So do I leave the names alone or change them and the JUnit tests?  I am passing all the adept tests but this one. Does anyone know what this test is doing because all my J-units are passing so i&#39;m not sure what to change.  What does the below test for:    Adept Test:  reallyFarAwayTest  Jedi Test:  unevenJediTest  Jedi Test:  onePoolStartsEmpty       1.  For adept, I tried putting the position at a really high number such as 9999, and it passes my JUnit but not on gradescope.       2.  For jedi, the previous Piazza JUnit test had uneven pools, and it passes that but it fails the gradescope test.       3.  Also in jedi, I added &#34;null&#34; in some of the driver pool like {null, d0, d2, d1, d3} and it iterates correctly, skipping the null and going to the next pool.  Yet again it fails the test on gradescope  I got 17/20 points on my code that i submitted on time. If I resubmit to gradescope to fix the errors, will I get half of the remaining (1.5) or will the rest of my points be graded as late too?  Tried throwing IllegalArgumentException, NoSuchElementException when all of the pools are empty in the constructor, but nothing seems to be accepted in gradescope. What does it want for this test? If I committed and pushed my code for adept and jedi to github, but didn&#39;t technically submit them on gradescope (only submitted my novice portion) will I have points deducted? Should I now resubmit on gradescope with all of my code on github?I opened the autograder after the 6am deadline expecting to see the new tests show up, but they aren&#39;t (Is it only me?). What should I do to get the remaining portion graded? I have not resubmitted, assuming that it will be counted as a late submission (Should I resubmit?). If we come into office hours will the LAs look over our code style assignment and let us know what we would get? I already submitted to gradescope but assuming I can resubmit if the LAs say I should do more.  I am trying to add iterators onto a list for Jedi, but I keep getting a null pointer exception.        while (bigIter.hasNext() ) { \t_ListOfIterator.add(bigIter.next().iterator()); }   any tips?  So I signed up for hack 401 and I really want to go, but I have plans for part of that saturday. Is it alright if I attend part of it and not the whole day? Thanks!  Could someone please hint to me why adept isn&#39;t working:      1st: check if nextDriver is not null, if so return true   2nd: while loop creating a temp driver varialbe of iter.next(), checking if tempdrivers manhanttan distance is &gt;= 1 &#43; (count-1)*exp step and &lt;= 1&#43;(count*exp step)           if so, next driver = temp driver and true is returned           if not then global variable outside = true because driver is out of ring, loop ends   3rd: count incremented by 1   4th: if outside is true, outside = false, reset the iter, return hasNext() to reloop through the drivers at the next ring   5th: else return false      I have been debugging for hours and cant fix it and office hours was very crowded to get the help i need     I am currently working on my A6 Jedi program, and I have gotten a general algorithm to snake through the different iterators. I am using a chain of ifs and else ifs after collecting each Driver to alter the index appropriately, so that each loop around, I can get the right iterator. This is working well, but at some point, for some reason, the program just stops, and I do not get the complete result that I am supposed to get within the test code. The output I get is:   Eddie Ennion  Liliana Pagano  Liliana Pagano  Liliana Pagano  maha Alhomoud  maha Alhomoud  maha Alhomoud  Liliana Pagano  maha Alhomoud  demoniaque something  demoniaque something  demoniaque something      Which is completely correct besides missing the last five drivers.   Is there any obvious reason that this would occur? I feel like I am very close to being done, so having such a small thing happen at the very end of my output is frustrating.      Edit: I realized that I was not processing the empty drivers correctly, so I created a new &#34;streak&#34; integer, that keeps track of how many lists have failed. I then made the algorithm switch to the next index if this one does not work and if streak is less than length. All of the items except for the last one now process correctly. However, I am now getting a nullpointerexception on the very last item, and I do not know why.  if you removed an item from a list at index 1, would the item originally at index 2 now be at index 1? so when you call index 1 after removing the original index 1, would you return the original index 2?  Logically it seems like the proximity limit value passed into the constuctor in Novice shouldn&#39;t be able to negative and the expansion step value passed into the constructor in Adept shougln&#39;t be able to negative or equal to zero, but it&#39;s not specified in the READ ME and the autograder for Novice does not test that the proximity limit value is non-negative. Should we be throwing exceptions in these cases anyway (particularly for Adept whose autograder won&#39;t be released until the assignment deadline)?  Could somebody please give me some pointers for how to approach A6 Jedi&#39;s hasNext()? I&#39;ve been trying to wrap my head around it for the better part the night and can&#39;t seem to get to an answer that makes sense. Thanks!  This was working earlier when I had different code, but now it&#39;s just not starting, and my computer seems to be running harder and being louder :/ I don&#39;t really think I did anything that would cause this. Maybe I have an infinite while loop? I tried to make my code avoid that but I don&#39;t know how to debug so I&#39;m stuck not knowing whether my code works for my tests or not        The assignment doesn&#39;t specify whether our a6 jedi is expected to iterate through driver_pools if one of the Iterable objects are null as apposed to the entire driver_pools list being null. Should we throw an exception for this or let the iterator skip over the empty Iterable? Same for Driver, if there is a single Driver that is null should we skip over it and continue iterating or throw an exception? For A6 Jedi, I created two methods to change the direction of the snake pattern. I found that if the immediate index was 0, I set the direction to be 1, and if the immediate index was the last index, I set the direction to be -1. My void method would physically add the index and direction together, but I can&#39;t seem to figure out how to repeat the last or the first index. Like conceptually, it would go 0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, etc. How do I account for this?  &#34;If after the deadline, your submission does not pass the Adept and Jedi tests, you may resubmit for 50% credit on the points you didn&#39;t already get.&#34;       Another Piazza Post had an instructor answer, &#34;Depending on how late the assignments are submitted, late points will be taken off appropriately (ex. submitting 2 min after deadline will take off less than submitting 2 days after the deadline)&#34; The syllabus reads that the maximum penalty is &#34;up to 50%&#34;.       The reason I ask is I waited for over an hour for office hours but they closed before I got a turn, so I would ideally like to go into office hours the afternoon of the due date to get help and some more credit.   When I run the tests KMP provided for novice on Eclipse, I am passing all of them. However, on gradescope, I am only getting 4 out of 20 points. I have already staged and pushed the changes before resubmitting. I am not sure why I am not getting all of the points?         My tests stopped running all of a sudden and they look like this. There is no failure trace, and it seems to be stuck on Adept because when I run Novice and Jedi individually, they work. Has anyone else ran into this problem/have any suggestions? I&#39;ve already tried deleting the Adept test and remaking it and it still doesn&#39;t work.   I am working on my A6 adept code, and when I try to reinitialize my iterator field with a new version of the iterator, I get an endless loop of &#34;demoniaque something&#34; after the first two items. I know reinitializing this iterator is a requirement in order for this code to work, unless I am missing something. It seems like in order to make this code scalable to any number of iterations of the code, it needs to be able to do this. When I create an &#34;iterator&#34; and &#34;iterator2&#34; and have the code within hasNext use the iterator2 instead of reinitializing the first one, the code functions as expected, with only one demonique. However, I obviously cannot make infinite new iterators within the constructor.   Am I missing something obvious? Do any of you have a suggestion on what to play with to keep the loop from activating infinitely? I am completely stumped.      Edit: I have been testing more things, and here&#39;s another fact I have found.   If I set iterator equal to iterator2, it will work without creating an infinite loop. However, since iterators are objects and not primitive values, I cannot repeat this more than once since iterating through this iterator again alters iterator2, making this equally as effective as if I had just iterated through a second iterator. Whenever I try to create a new iterator and assign it to my iterator field, that&#39;s when it repeats the same name infinitely.      Edit: I found a workaround, but the problem still doesn&#39;t make sense to me. I decided to make an array of iterators, and initialize them all, and then swap them out whenever I needed a new iterator. It works, but I am still curious as to why this was an issue in the first place.  For A6&#39;s SnakeOrderAcrossPools Iterator, I know we should throw an exception if the driver_pools list is null. However, should we also throw an exception if an element within the driver_pools list is null?  I don&#39;t understand the point of this test.  The driver_pool is an object that can be modified outside of this class.     For jedi I am trying to encapsulate a list of driver iterators to access throughout the code.  the list is called &#39;allIters&#39;. In the constructor, I run a for loop to create &#39;allIters&#39;:      for (int i = 0; i &lt; driver_pools.size(); i&#43;&#43;) {    // here I create an iterator for the element at index i called &#39;thisIter&#39; then use .add:   allIters.add(thisIter);      }      when I run my JUnit tests my code consistently fails here. Anyone have any other methods to add elements to the List of driver iterators in the constructor?  I&#39;m testing my Novice in Gradescope and only getting 2 points, but when I test it in Eclipse with the J Unit tests KMP sent out, I&#39;m passing all the tests. Does anyone have any idea where the disconnect could be? Thanks!  Why is it showing:     NullPositionConstructorTest  NullPoolConstructorExceptionTest       I&#39;ve tried throwing NullPointerExceptions for if the driver_pool is null and if client_position is null but it doesn&#39;t fix the error  I know the adept and jedi tests will be released after the deadline, will the grader for adept and jedi be released soon?   In the constructor do we need check if the expansion step is greater than zero, or is it equally valid if the expansion step is zero?         Should the line that says &#34;fail(&#34;Should have thrown IllegalArgumentException&#34;);&#34; be in the catch statement right below it? Because the way it is written now, no matter what happens in the code, the test is going to fail.  How can we get 20 points if maximum is only 10?         When I submitted my code to the autograder, this message came up:       Does anyone know why this problem is coming up?  I tried to submit my assignment on gradescope I am getting an error that says:    &#34;The autograder failed to execute correctly. Contact your course staff for help in debugging this issue. Make sure to include a link to this page so that they can help you most effectively.&#34;    Does anyone know what may be going wrong? Thanks!  for the adept test, I am getting   Eddie Ennion (correct)   Liliana Pagano (correct)   demoniaque something (correct)   demoniaque something   demoniaque something      can anyone suggest what may be causing this repeat? I tried tweaking my hasNext code a few times, but ended up just messing up the first three correct ones.  Do we need to comment the Deck/DeckImpl in the code style assignment since a description Deck is not included in the assignment&#39;s Read Me? If so, what&#39;s the best way to go about doing so? I personally don&#39;t know much about poker so I was using the Read Me in order to include comments that weren&#39;t simply restating what the code was doing on a literal level, but I don&#39;t really understand what Deck is is abstracting without additional description.       Thanks!  In adept, I coded two while loops that are nested within one main loop. One checks for drivers that meet the conditions for the first ring, and the second looks for drivers beyond the first ring, but fall within the (1 &#43; (n * expansion_step)) condition. I&#39;ve ran the debugger, and the problem seems to be that because I create a new iterator of the driver pool each time I return true in these loops, my code never gets past the first ring.       I&#39;m not sure how to approach this issue, does anyone have any pointers/tips on this? Any help is appreciated -- thank you!!  What I did was create a new Iterable&lt;Driver&gt; that&#39;s a copy of driver_pool and make an ArrayList of Drivers. Then I used the forEach method and did ArrayList::add for each Driver in the Iterable. Then I called a list.size() method to find the size of the pool. Is that what yall are doing or is there another way KMP wants us to find the size?      List&lt;Driver&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;Driver&gt;(); Iterable&lt;Driver&gt; _iterable_pool_size = _driver_pool;  _iterable_pool_size.forEach(list::add); _pool_size = list.size();     my eclipse wont open, everytime i try to open up my workspace it gives me a pop-up saying: An error has occurred. See the log file C:\\Users\\brian\\eclipse-workspace\\.metadata\\.log      does anyone know how to fix this? im scared that i will lose all my data, including the ones from a6 if i tried to reinstall eclipse  I have my SnakeOrderAcrossPoolsIterator working until a pool is reached with no more drivers in it, where it throws a Null Pointer Exception.  How would I &#34;skip&#34; over the pools with no more drivers so that this exception is not thrown?      Thank you!  If a list only has 4 driver collections and we set an variable to the 4th index of the list, would that variable be null?      ex.    Iterator&lt;Driver&gt; driverCollection = driver_pools.get(j).iterator();     Where j = 4. Would driverCollection equal to null given that there is only 4 driverpools and none at the fourth index?   I encapsulated an iterable&lt;Driver&gt; object and an Iterator&lt;Driver&gt; object. In the ExpandingProximityIterator, I set the Iterator object to the iterable iterator() method, example: iterator = driverIterator.iterator().      In my hasNext() method I can go through the set of drivers that are &lt;= 1 but going into the next ring I simply do iterator = driverIterator.iterator() and it will iterate through the list of drivers up to a certain point and then start from the beginning all over again rather than continue on with the list. For example, if driver 2 and driver 4 meet the condition, it will iterate through driver 1, driver 2, and then start back at driver 1 again rather than going to driver 3 and on.. etc.      However, if I create a second iterator in ExpandingProximityIterator (iterator2 = driverIterator.iterator()), it will iterate just fine, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s going to help with finding drivers in the increasing ring requirements.      Any clues on what could be causing this? I&#39;m stuck on this part.  For ExpandingProximityIterator, I am getting:      Eddie Ennion      Liliana Pagano      Yazid Alamry      demoniaque something      Yazid Alamry      Yazid Alamry      maha Alhomoud      Yazid Alamry      I know that this is happening because in between each expansion, hasNext() is true so it is printing out &#34;Yazid Alamry.&#34; Does anyone know how to move to the next expansion without returning true for hasNext()?  I have figured out how to snake through the pools in increasing order, but I can&#39;t figure out how to snake backwards through the pools once it reaches the last pool.  Can any point me in the right direction for where I should go? Thanks!  Will we be allowed to see our grade and resubmit the code style assignment multiple times?  Can someone explain how to put the Junit tests into eclipse? I&#39;m having trouble getting them to run and i don&#39;t know if I&#39;m doing something completely wrong - I made sure to add the junit test to the classpath and made sure the a6 project is linked to it as well. any help would be appreciated! also big thank you to the people who shared their junit test code on piazza!  First, when will our midterm be graded to completion? The last section is still not graded. Also, a6 has still not been posted on Gradescope. Will there be an extension?       Lastly, for the code grading assignment, I thought we were supposed to go into office hours to have it graded but nothing has been said about this.       I would really appreciate it if one of the TAs could address these questions :) Thank you!  There is an entry for code style on gradescope, but when I tried to upload my code, it says there is no autograder configured. Is this a problem with my computer or is there just no autograder yet (which would be fine, I just want to make sure gradescope works for me)?  I was just starting on the Code Style project, and  the constructor you provide is &#34;public CardImpl(int rank, Card.Suit suite)&#34;      Is it supposed to be suit or suite? Thanks for the help.  In essence, how is ProximityIterator even used if it were to be used in some program? I&#39;m confused on how an Iterator class works overall, but mostly understand how iterators on their own are used.  Did anyone get additional ten points for their midterm grade. Our professor said he hasn&#39;t put them in yet, but did anyone get their additional ten points yet. I&#39;m not sure if I got mine  Since the A6 will due the next Tuesday, when will the grader be released? Thanks! Appreciate it!  I am struggling with trying to figure out how to implement the methods and how to iterate through the pool multiple times while changing the size. Can anyone give a push in the right direction?  Is the example code used to help us get started on A6 posted anywhere online? I don&#39;t see it in the lecture 14 example code repository. If it&#39;s not, is there any way it could be posted because I was not able to write it all down in class. Thanks!  What if there was a computer science-themed karaoke at the 401 Hackathon?! That would be a fun event to add to the current events that they are planning.          *This idea is not associated with Shannon&#39;s karaoke idea, at all.  Here are JUnit tests I made for A6. They are a bit rough but I think they work.       novice.java     adept.java     jedi.java   Hi,   I am working on adept and have not had any issues, but when I put in the test code I am only getting this:      Eddie Ennion      Liliana Pagano      demoniaque something      Yazid Alamry      when it should be:   Eddie Ennion      Liliana Pagano      demoniaque something      Yazid Alamry      maha Alhomoud      I&#39;m not too sure what I am doing wrong but if anyone has any clue about why its cutting off I would love some advice!  Are we supposed to write comments for any methods or implementations in A6?  Hi,    I&#39;m working through the code styling assignment right now and have two questions.      The first is if we are allowed to change method names. I see an obvious getter that is misnamed, but if i change the method name then it will fail the JUnit test? Does this mean that I should change the name or just leave it alone so that it passes the test.      The second is if we are supposed to reimplement the code too. There are some things that I would have implemented differently / put in different places. Are we supposed to reimplement the methods or assume that their current implementation is acceptable since it technically passes the JUnit tests?      Thanks!  I have been working on A6 locally and now when I try to clone the git repository in eclipse I am getting a transport error. For possible reasons, it tells me invalid URL or no internet connection, when neither is the case. Does anybody know any possible solutions?  How do we reset the iterations every time we check for a particular case ring?   I am trying to go for the second approach so I created a method that returns the size of our Iterable&lt;Driver&gt; and created a global variable to keep the count of drivers.       Any ideas?  Can someone explain what we are trying to find in adept? What is the expansion step?do we need to use the void remove() method?           Hey,   When is the submission link for assignment 6 going to be up?         Probably a dumb question but where/how do we submit the code style assignment?   Here is my test package for A6      extract the package to your src file and run the test_class code      https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jtXmwIWdYs1pDSRI2nOPj4bjqT64lRc9/view?usp=sharing      It&#39;s something until the autograder is up    Do we use the iterator that KMP suggests in the &#34;Tips&#34; section as a way to iterate through drivers in Novice, or should we use a for-each loop and use the iterator for something else?      Just confused on how to use the iterator instance variable that KMP recommends...  Can anyone tell me what is the criteria for selecting an available driver in Jedi? I don&#39;t know what is the rule we need to use to select the driver?  Is that still the same as the Adept or Novice which requires the available driver must greater than or smaller than a proximity value?   During class I thought I understood KMP&#39;s code, but I&#39;m confused now, and unfortunately I didn&#39;t think to write it down. Is there anyway I can access it?  Just wanted to clarify something from last thursday&#39;s lecture. In the code KMP showed us to explain the project, I have written down that the code which has the boundaries for filtering out the iterator for different values (like how the distance has to equal the client position in A1) in the hasNext() method. I wanted to make sure this was correct and I didn&#39;t write my notes wrong.         I&#39;m confused about this instance field: &#34;Use an instance field to store the next driver that matches the proximity limit. Initialize this to null in your constructor&#34;      Does this mean we need to declare the field as an iterable to store all of the values that match the proximity limit?   When will A6 be set up in gradescope?   Are we going to have JUnit Test for this assignment?  Should we submit a regrade request on Gradescope and also send an email with reasons to KMP?  T/F: The class Object has an is-a relationship with all other classes   Why is this false?  Will we have any points off if we only attend 9/12 of the recitation?  http://java-x.blogspot.com/2007/01/implementing-decorator-pattern-in-java.html  Where/When will we be notified if a recitation is optional? Like is the recitation tomorrow optional? Where do we go for updates?  What&#39;s the situation regarding quizzes? We&#39;ve only had three, and I have a 0/3 for one of them as do many other people. Even though it is only 10% of the grade, I feel like it will still drag my grade down since there have been so few. Will there be more in the future? Will any of them be dropped?   Version D:   In the code writing section, Person Class, I used the &#34;protected&#34; keyword for fields and lost a point.    My classmates told me they did not lose points for this.   Could I get the point back?   1.17. The == operator in Java will test if two string objects represent the same sequence of characters. &#34;False&#34;           Just as the execute result and the slides above show, in Java &#34;==&#34; will test if two string objects represent the same sequence of characters, but we should not do so. However, in 1.17, the question is whether &#34;The == operator in Java will test if two string objects represent the same sequence of characters&#34;, so the &#34;false&#34; answer is a little bit weird since it actually will do so.   Form A   True/False 1.18:   The question reads &#34;If interB is a subclass of interA, then any object that implements interB must implement interA.&#34;       The correct answer was true but I said that this was false, my reasoning being that classes/objects cannot implement other classes, they can only extend other classes, therefore it is impossible for an object to implement interB, which is a class. Is this one true because it is technically vacuously true, or should it be false?      I found an instance when a statement that was vacuously true was not marked as true by the grader, part III code Comprehension Question 3.3 line C:   There was an option: &#34;If the call to the constructor is not allowed, the error is discovered when the program is compiled&#34;. The premise is false because the call to the constructor is allowed (that was the correct answer), thus this statement is vacuously true, however this statement was not marked as true in the grading.      Therefore there is a contradiction on whether vacuously true statements, which are if then statements where the premise is false, are considered true or false by the grader.      For example if a True/False question is &#34;If 1 &#43; 1 = 3 then all dogs can fly&#34;, should this be true because it is vacuously true or should it be false because the premise is false?              Hello,   I was wondering if anyone else still has their quiz grade for 10/3 as 0/3 points? I did take the quiz and sakai shows that I submitted it but I still have 0 points. Thanks!  True/False:      Methods in Java are always virtual --&gt; shouldn&#39;t this be False because we learned that virtualness can be turned off with the super keyword implying that methods in java are not &#39;always&#39; virtual.       The class Object has an is-a relationship with all other classes --&gt; shouldn&#39;t this be true because Object is a parent class of all classes, and therefore there is an is-a relationship.   I thought our Gradescope grades were going to be published yesterday? Even though I know my grade on Sakai, I still would like to see what I got wrong because this is still a factor whether I choose to drop the course.   Hi! I was just wondering when A6 would be posted, I would love to get started on it!  Went to class yesterday and tried to open my eclipse and I got this error message       I tried removing the .metadata in my eclipse home folder, but nothing was changed. The error log shows that none of the commands in eclipse.ini are being run properly. Has anyone else had this issue?  Today when I opened my mac, eclipse was gone. I couldn&#39;t find it in applications. I of course still have the .dmg file but is the only way to get it back to install it again? Is there any way to recover it the way it was with all the packages/code I had already imported.          Are we required to write the codes of iterators by ourselves (like lec12.ex2 did)? Or, could we just use object.iterator() and for-each loop?  Are we gonna have our scores curved and when should we expect to have our solid grades for this exam? I&#39;m still deciding on the pass/fail thing but I feel like without the solid score I&#39;m hesitating.  For some reason I never got my grade back on the midterm in Gradescope. Is there a reason for this?  Say I got a 70/90 = 77.77% on the midterm and 8/10 on the last problem.       Is my final midterm grade 78/100 = 78% or 78/90 = 86.6% ?  It isn&#39;t on the syllabus  Did anyone get their midterm grade back yet? I am too scared to look I just wanna see if anyone else got theirs back  When I submitted my code with changes to my Roll class for Jedi, GradeScope failed the tests for Adept that would be affected by those changes but passed the tests for Jedi. Is this normal, or am I doing something incorrectly?  At the time of the normal deadline, I had all but 2 tests passed. I attempted to fix my code now but I&#39;m still getting everything but the last two jedi seaweed tests.      Will I still get points off based on the Late Submission policy even if there is no difference in the test cases passed between the normal deadline and the late deadline? Approx time when midterm grades will be released? I&#39;ve been working on A5 Jedi for a long time and for some reason I keep failing all the tests in the auto grader. I&#39;ve tested out my code using my own tests and everything runs fine, so I don&#39;t understand what is going wrong. Any tips?   What should I do?  I&#39;ve been stuck on the same 2 Jedi errors since the morning and have tried both Arraylist and Hashmaps for this but still have the same error (on the same line too) (     Jedi Test: testAddEnoughSeaweedIfNot (0.0/0.67)  (A5JediTests.line87)   Jedi Test: testAddSeaweedIfNot (0.0/0.67)  (A5JediTests.line61)       I basically create an arraylist and use the combine method. To test seaweed, I parse through the arraylist, check if seaweed is in the arraylist; if the amt is &lt; 0.1, i make a new seaweedportion object with the amount of 0.1. If there was no seaweed at all, I add a seaweed portion of 0.1 amount. Then I convert it to an array. This is all done in the constructor.      I don&#39;t get why I&#39;m failing these two tests.  Could you please help me?     For A5 adept, how are the classes we need to implement (sashimi, nigiri, and roll) supposed to retrieve the info needed to implement their methods?  I&#39;m using nested for loops and arraylists to check for duplicates. If there is a duplicate, I take out the duplicated ingredient out of my list and add the combined version in. At the end, I add every ingredient in the list to the original array, but am failing the Jedi test for it. Any advice?  Also, all the test in Gradescope for Roll class passed.   Does anyone know how to deal with the situation? It&#39;s weird because A5 Junit tests in Eclipse pass.     I am working on eliminating duplicates in the array. I&#39;m using a double for loop to compare all of the elements within the cloned array with itself. I&#39;ve created an ArrayList to store my non-repeated and combined ingredients. Inside the double for loops, I am using the remove and add methods to combine duplicates into the ArrayList. The code seems to be right when going through it in my head but it is not passing in Gradescope and I am not sure how to approach debugging it.      Any help would be much appreciated!! Thank you!  How long after the due date are late assignments able to be submitted? What is the late policy for grading?   Hello,   For Novice, I have passed all of my tests but testRice() will not pass and I believe that my super statement is correct as it has worked for the rest of my ingredients. Also, testBadCombine() does not work but I used an IllegalArgumentException if !other.getIngredient().equals(this.getIngredient());   Does anyone have an idea as to what the problem might be? Thank you!  When will A6 be posted? I&#39;d love to work on that during fall break. Thanks! Appreciate it!  How do you get e) d.m(2.0) = 9? Also how do you know when you can stop and have your answer?    So, I understand that IngredientPortionImpl is the parent class of each IngredientPortion (AvocadoPortion(), CrabPortion(), etc.) like IngredientImpl is the parent class for each of the ingredients (Avocado(), Crab(), etc.).   However, is IngredientPortionImpl supposed to be a subclass of IngredientImpl???   If not, is IngredientPortionImpl only supposed to encapsulate an Ingredient in it?      I&#39;ve written all the code for the portion aspect of Novice but the grader won&#39;t pass the tests...  Will there be an option to retake the exam if we did not do well? If not will there be any opportunity for extra credit to get some points back?       I made a mistake and spent too much time on the &#34;Writing Code&#34; section and didn&#39;t allocate enough time to complete part 3 and part 4 thoroughly. I really feel 75 minutes was not enough time to complete such a lengthy exam. I prepared well and I understand the material but simply did not have enough time for all the questions. 120 minutes would&#39;ve been an appropriate amount of time to complete the exam fully.       Any option to get some additional points  back on the midterm would be much appreciated (optional homework/project/research paper ???)  Will there be a curve on the midterm?  Why is this false? &#34;An object reference is not a valid expression.&#34;       It seems to suggest that objects can be used in expressions, but I thought expressions needed to simplify to a single value.   Why is this true?       Overriding is an example of polymorphism and the name and the signature remains the same. It only changes the definition of the method.  On the 2014 fall midterm, for the last part, why can I not declare the memory size variable in the abstract class Phone since all the subclasses have some value of memory size? Would it be considered incorrect if I did this?      Thank you!  Just to confirm with the announcement on Sakai, we don&#39;t need to bring any scantrons or blue books to the exam right? All we need is a pen / pencil?   for this question,       c.m1(1, 2, 3)  the answer is -2 but I got 1?      So when you call m1 in class See, it will result in    m2(2,3) - m2(1,1)   From there we will call m2 in class Bee, which will call super for m2(2,3) and goes to class Aye. Then, m2(1,1) will go to m1 in class Bee, unless I am mistaken. Doing what I did, it got me 3 - 2. Since this is not correct, I am unclear whether the m2(1,1) will go back to class See or go to Aye. I tried both ways and still didn&#39;t get -2 as the answer.  In the 2014 midterm 2, there&#39;s a question in part 3 that asks you to what the value of  ((Doh) r).m(“Brooks”) is. This was able to compile and the answer was 4. However, in the 2018 fall midterm there&#39;s a similar question in part 3 that asks you what the value of ((Bee) d).m2(1, 2, 3) is but the answer was that this would not compile. I thought it would compile and get a valid result based on the answer from the 2014 midterm. Can someone explain why this is? I try to do it step by step and I got 11 as answer. Can someone help me to solve this     Can someone please go throw part 4 d of try-catch blocks step by step   Midterm of Spring 2014 says:   &#34;An expression can always be used where ever a value is required.&#34;       Midterm of Spring 2015 says:   &#34;A variable cannot be assigned the result of any expression.&#34;      Is this contradictory?      I know there are some errors among the practice tests, but I wanted to be sure that I don&#39;t have any flawed logic.   Will we have question on Composition, Aggregation and Delegation on the exam? I know iterators won&#39;t be on the exam.  Can someone explain to me the difference between static and instance methods? Thanks!  12) Which of these are valid variable names in Java?   a) 1direction   *b) a_var   c) break   *d) AVar_   *e) more$moreProblems      Why is AVar valid? KMP literally said to never have a variable name start with a capital letter.  In 2013 Midterm 1 #22, why do we regard getCurrentLeader() also as a getter following the JavaBeans convention? Since there&#39;s no any properties in class Scoreboard named &#34;CurrentLeader&#34;. Thanks a lot!   A parent class has direct access to protected fields within a subclass (True or False)      For some reason this is false, but I thought that the protected keyword allows access to the variables within that class from parent/subclasses???   In recitation, I thought we used an abstract class in the sandwich example but the uploaded answer doesn&#39;t have it so which should we do on the exam?   Screen_Shot_20191014_at_2.10.42_PM.png      Could someone run through foo(2)? Greatly appreciate any help.     According to the java tutorial of Oracle, the method signature of a method includes a method&#39;s name and its parameter list. But In the #4 of 2014 Midterm 1, the statement that&#34;the method signature indicates the return type of the method&#34; is true. So what is exactly the definition of   Method Signature  ? Thanks! are switch statements going to be tested on the midterm? The question reads:      F 8. A variable can be assigned the result of any expression.      Can you explain why this is a false statement? Is this statement referring to a specific variable, so only results that are of the same type can be assigned? If you were to interpret it as &#34;The result of any expression be assigned to a variable,&#34; then would it be True?  what does the statement    &#34;A derived property is computed as a function of an object&#39;s state.&#34;   mean exactly?  Just to confirm, the midterm is only on lectures 1-11 right? Not lecture 12 also?          ((Doh) r).m(“Brooks”)      We see Ray r = new Ray() and Ray extends Doh. Under this notation, should we use method m in Ray or m in Doh?    What&#39;s the logic here?           What does a method call that looks like this mean/why is the Doh part in parentheses? Is it just invoking r&#39;s method m, or is it assigning a new Ray to Doh then calling Doh&#39;s method M?       ((Doh) r).m(“Brooks”)          I have a couple questions from the sample exams that I have not yet seen others ask:      2013:   #8. Which of these statements about Java interfaces are true?   a) Interfaces define a set of private methods that an object implements.   b) Interface names are not valid data types for variables.   c) Interfaces provide default implementations for specified methods.   *d) Interfaces can be extended using inheritance.   *e) Interfaces never specify constructors      How come c) is not also correct? Is it because interfaces do not *always* implement default methods? Would c) be a correct choice if it read &#34;Interfaces CAN provide default implementations for specified methods.&#34;?      2014:   #14. Which of the following statements is true of classes?   a) A class must include at least one constructor that accepts parameters.   *b) The this keyword is not meaningful within the body of a class method.   *c) A public class field can be accessed using the class name.   *d) The class name acts as a type name for objects of that class.   e) Two classes in the same package may be given the same name as long as they define different instance fields.      Can you explain what b) and c) mean and why they are correct choices?     How to translate the final grade (out of 100 points) to the graduate grade scale? (H,P,L,F)   The answer of (c) is 9 while what I get is -2. I put the code of Part III of the test in the computer and it turns out to be 2. Is the answer to Part III (C) wrong?      I am obviously not understanding how switch statements work because i am not getting 7 out of this. can someone explain it to me Barney style?  17) What is the value of x after the code below executes? Answer: _______7___  int x = 3;   int y = 1;   switch(x-y) {    case 0: x &#43;= y; break;   case 2: y &#43;= 3;   case 4: x &#43;= y; break;   case 6: x &#43;= 3;   default: x = 0; y = 0;   }  Is the lecture on iterators on this midterm? Can&#39;t remember what KMP said in class.  Thanks!   I don&#39;t why this test is failing for me because I followed the same format as Sashimi except made the array size 2 instead of one, and made the 2nd index (index 1) &#34;new RicePortion(0.5)&#34; for all types of seafood. I see the autograder even checks this as well, but I&#39;m not getting credit for this. Any help?  For Part III: Overriding and Overloading, why does  ((Bee) d).m2(1, 2, 3)  not compile? I thought since Java uses virtual methods, it&#39;ll just use the  m2  method from  d ? Can someone explain why this reasoning is wrong? Thanks!       Can you please answer which lines are valid and which are not and why not using keywords like &#34;parent&#34;, &#34;child&#34;, &#34;sub&#34;, etc?    I&#39;m passing all of my Junit test for the JediAddEnoughSeaweedIfNot and JediAddSeaweedIfNot (I have the correct ounces and prices, according to my Junit tests). Is anyone else having this problem? Do you know what to do?  What&#39;s the difference between a Ragged Array and a Ragged ArrayList? When would you use each?  In this part of the exam, c.m1(1,2,3) calls class See&#39;s method m1. This in turn calls a method m2. Is the method called the one belonging to class Bee, or to class Aye? I was thinking that since See extends Bee, and Bee overrides the m2 method from Aye, it should be Bee&#39;s method.  I&#39;m struggling a bit with the rules of inheritance. Could anyone remind me which of these are and are not okay? i know the first two are fine since song implements Media and Compresses, I&#39;m unsure about the next two, I think the two after that are fine, and I don&#39;t know about the last one.      I guess my main question is, if an object is declared as a Media object but is assigned a Song object as its value, can it do anything a Song can?  After looking at the answer below, I am really confused. Wouldn&#39;t the second if-statement always be true?    Please help    Spring_Midterm_2015_Answer.JPG    Screen_Shot_20191012_at_3.24.46_PM.png      Can someone pls explain how the answers were obtained for the above section?    Hi! I have almost figured out how to solve the foo problem but I&#39;m having trouble understanding why foo(2) works and foo(3) does not work.   Copied Directly From a lecture slide:           •  The body of a method is a sequence of statements.   •  A statement ends in a semi colon   –  Types of statements: •  Declarations of local variables    •  Assignment •  Conditonal •  Loop •  Method call •  Return statement      My question is how is a condition a type of statement if an &#39;IF&#39; statement is formatted as such:   if (condition) {    //statements in here   }      But the if-statement itself does not end in a semicolon? Does it mean that it is a statement because the body of a conditional is composed of statements?              Was this done on purpose, is it a bug on my end, or is that just the way the points work out? This isn&#39;t really that important of a question I was just curious.  16) What is the value of the variable “result” after the code below executes? Answer: _____60_____   int[] a = new int[] {10, 20, 30};   int[] b = new int[] {2, 1, 0};   int[] c = a;   int[] d = b;   c[0] = d[2];   a[1] = c[d[b[2]]];   int result = a[0] &#43; a[1] &#43; a[2];      I am consistently getting 70?  1.   c) A subclass can change the access modifier of a parent class field by redeclaring the field   The answer is false   I tried to declare a protected field in the parent and redeclare it as a public field in the child, but the eclipse can still compile. What&#39;s my mistake...?      b) Two subclasses with a common parent class have direct access to each other&#39;s public fields   The answer is true   I tried on IDE and found that the siblings cannot access a public field of the other unless the public field is also static. However, a public static field can also be accessed anywhere by calling the class name. Did I misinterpret the question?      4.    d) Encapsulated objects of a composition will also be compositions   I know this is false but cannot find a specific example... Thank you in advance for helping me out!     Can we treat the types of sushi as Strings? If not, then how should we access the Ingredient associated with the specific type? Thanks!   No worries. I have used toString() to find the name and passed the tests.  In this practice test, question 12 said that AVar_ is a valid variable name. But KMP said that we should not use capital letters at the beginning of variable name. So I&#39;m confused.  Will the midterm structured similarly to former practice exams?         Why is this true? If we declare the variable to be public we can access it anywhere.            * c) A return statement in a method ends the execution of the method.       This option is mak as true.        If the method is void then it will not have a return statement?   what do you guys think? I think it is not specific to what the method type is and it should so I considered it FALSE.      I&#39;ve been trying for a long time to do the duplicates, but I&#39;m very stuck (I&#39;m using ArrayLists). Currently I&#39;m using a double for loop to try and find the duplicates, but for some reason, it won&#39;t work. Any tips?     //When a method (call it\t  method\t  A) is called from within another method //(call it method B), the code within method A can access local variables within method B  //at the point where the call to method A was made.\t   public static void scopeOne() {      String myName = &#34;name&#34;;     scopeTwo(myName); }  public static void scopeTwo(String myName) {      System.out.println(myName); }     I think the statement is true and here is my example.      Please point out my mistakes!  My reciatation leader said today that an object&#39;s type and which methods it has access to is defined by what implementation it is. For example, in Sandwich sandwich = new GrilledCheese();, the type and therefore what methods it has access to would be GrilledCheese. GrilledCheese here being a class that implements the Sandwich interface.  I thought it was the opposite. I thought the type of a reference variable is defined to the left of the variable name. Isn&#39;t that the point of polymorphism? Regardless of specific implementation, we can change the type of the variable and its method scope to fit our needs.Can we please get the answers to the last quiz we took? Also, Katherine said they are probably for attendance only, but maybe not. Can someone confirm? whats the website that he showed us in class that makes environment diagrams as it loops through code?  True/False &#34;A specific array can hold values of any type&#34;: False      is it false because the values must be of the same type? or are there some values that arrays cannot hold at all?  Really trying to go home early today. How many absences do we have without repercussions?  It&#39;s more like a question about program design.   In A5, If we want an avocado, we can do this instead of creating a new class:   Ingredient avocado = new IngredientImpl(&#34;avocado&#34;, 0.24, 42, true, false, false)   Apparently, we just need one type of avocado in this case. We will not have different instances of Avocado, such as  Avocado a, Avocado b.    So why we need to create so many classes?     Should we be doing only the Midterm 1s? Or should we be practicing both Midterms 1 and 2?  If you copied the sashimi enum from the assignment instructions, make sure you change YELLOwTAIL to YELLOWTAIL.  #14 on the Spring 2013 midterm says:  Which of the following statements is true of objects? a) Every object is associated with a class. b) Every object is associated with at least one interface. c) Two object references that have the same value refer to the same object. d) The state of an object is determined by the current values of its instance fields. e) A new copy of an object is created when it is passed to a method as a parameter.  The answer key says that a, c, and d are correct. I understand why d is correct, but not a and c.      For a, it is my understanding that  not  every object is associated with a class, since objects can be associated with interfaces. For example,  List&lt;String&gt; list  is an object but is not associated with a class until it is instantiated as a type of list. Instead, it is associated with an interface.      For c, say you declare two arrays  int[] arr1 = {1, 2, 3}  and  int[] arr2 = {1, 2, 3} . Even though both arrays contain the same values, each reference points to a different location in memory, which means they are  not  referring to the same object, correct?      If someone could point out errors in my logic or provide an explanation for why answer choices a and c are considered true, it would be extremely helpful.     One of the practice exams has various questions on subinterfaces, I don&#39;t recall learning about subinterfaces. If we did cover subinterfaces and my memory is failing me can someone tell me which powerpoint it is in.  are we allowed to listen to music during the midterm?      Novice Test: testBadCombine (0.0/0.21)    Adept Test: testRollGetCost (0.0/0.29)    Adept Test: testRollGetIngredients (0.0/0.29)    Jedi Test: testAddDuplicates (0.0/0.67)    Jedi Test: testAddEnoughSeaweedIfNot (0.0/0.67)     Any ideas????  I am confused by this instruction: The  Ingredient  associated with each of these classes should be an instance of the corresponding ingredient class (i.e.,  AvocadoPortion  should use an instance of  Avocado  as its ingredient).      Can anyone explain this? Thanks so much!  As confirmed with KMP, you do NOT need a scantron for the midterm.  Im failing both gradescope tests for seaweed in jedi. In my own test code, I called one roll without enough seaweed and one with enough seaweed, and my code ran how it was supposed to (supplied .1 to the one without enough and left the other one alone). Any ideas?      Update: fixing getCalories() solved the issue. thanks so much!  Anyone who came to office hours today around 12-1pm, someone left a black bag with an iclicker in here  How do we set up the method in the Sushi implementations for getIngredients()? I&#39;m unsure what is supposed to go into the array of IngredientPortions and how we are supposed to do that. Will it only be one or two things in the array based on what the kind of shushi has as ingredients?      Update: I realized that you have to use switch(type) and then cases for each of the possible enumerations.  My IngredientPortions (AvocadoPortion, SeaweedPortion, etc) are all failing in the autograder. However, I&#39;ve run them through my own tests and insured outputs are as they should be. I&#39;m trowing exceptions as well. I can&#39;t see anything in the instructions that I haven&#39;t accounted for either. What could be causing this?  I&#39;d like to attempt all the exams without answers  I got the correct answer in my own JUnit test, but fail in gradescope. I think the problem is with the number of decimals of the result. For example, I got 1.25999999 instead of 1.26. Does any one has any suggestions for this problem? I put my code into grade scope and everything works except for this test. I have tried everything and I do not understand why testBadCombine isn&#39;t working. I have a runtime exception listed and it should work. If anyone has any advice or suggestions that would be great!   UPDATE: Ok, there is no problem with the autograder.   TL;DR This question is not likely going to help you.   Original question:    Adept is having a clone test for Roll class&#39; IngredientPortion array and Jedi wants me to combine the same ingredients and add seaweed if it doesn&#39;t exist, which would result in something which is not a clone.  I have been able to combine the same ingredients and add seaweed if needed, but in that case, I think there is no need for cloning. Nevertheless, even in this case I am returning a cloned array and taking the clone of the array given to the constructor before working on deciding the values of my internal IngredientPortion array.    I am getting only the Roll class stuff wrong on the Autograder.    If someone has been able to get everything right, then please let me know that there is nothing wrong with the autograder, so that I can devote more time to my Roll class.  Under Part III: Overriding and Overloading, b) c.m1(1, 2, 3) says its answer is -2. Can someone explain the path to finding it&#39;s -2? I understood the answer for all of the other ones, but keep end up getting 1 for this one and I can&#39;t figure it out.    Is there any way that assignment 5 can be due on the 16th at 6 am instead of the 15th at 6 am, so that if there are some people that haven&#39;t finished the assignment, they&#39;re not stressed over studying for the midterm and finishing the assignment?            When will the junit test be posted for A5?? Also the in-class quiz that we took last week has still not been corrected. When will this be addressed?   Spring 2013 Midterm Says:         Q: Which of these are valid built-in Java data types?   A: String      Spring 2015 Midterm Says:   Q: String is a built-in value type in Java   A: False      Can someone explain why the first one is true and the second is false?        Looking at a question from a previous midterm:            A parent class has direct access to protected fields within a subclass.      The correct answer is false. Can someone explain what the question is even asking? I would guess false because im not sure what is being stated.        I am wondering if I get 9/10 points before the due date while I get to pass all the Junit tests after the due date and before the late due date. Do I need to resubmit it? How will my scores be calculated?  Question from a past exam:      Which of these statements properly declares a named constant?   a) static final public int A_CONSTANT = 3;   e) static final public int A_CONSTANT;      According to the answer key, A is correct while E is wrong. When I tested around, i found that you can declare a final variable and give it a value later. So why is E wrong; you have declared a constant, you just havent assigned it a value?  Whenever I run my code through the JUnit tests in Eclipse, it passes, but as soon as I submit it to gradescope it fails every single test. Does anyone know how I can go about fixing this error?  which lecture # will the midterm material go through? 1 through 11 or further than 11?  When will the j unit test be available for a5. I&#39;m sure a lot of us are trying to finish this assignment rather soon so that we can focus studying for the exam.   I created an implementation of Ingredient called IngredientImpl which takes name, price per oz, and cals per oz as inputs. then I have subclasses (using extends IngredientImpl) for each of the ingredients. I have them as public Avocado() like the instructions say to. But, when I try to create an Avocado object for example, it says it&#39;s not visible. Why can&#39;t I access the class Avocado?  If the total sum of seaweed doesn&#39;t amount to 0.1 ounces, are we supposed to add a portion of seaweed to top off the amount to 0.1 (e.g. if there&#39;s a total of 0.05 ounces of seaweed, add a new SeaweedPortion of 0.05 ounces) or strictly add a new SeaweedPortion of 0.1 ounces?  I know it is OK to say &#39;inherit a class&#39;. But maybe it is better to &#39;implement an interface&#39;?  When will the JUnit Test be available for A5? Did anyone else mistakingly think the quiz today was for completion like the last two? RIP Is there any way to see the correct answers for the quiz we had today to help for the midterm?  KMP said the quiz will give at least 1 point but I have a 0/3. What is up with that? Does it actually count towards the grade?  Will Assignment 5 be graded on style, comments, etc.?  For number 5 on the fall 2018 midterm that is a true or false question and it says the answer is true. Can anyone help me understand what this question is asking and why it is true?  5. A block of statements delimited by curly braces can be used anywhere a single statement is normally expected.      also to get to the practice exams (at least that i have found) go here:  http://www.cs.unc.edu/~kmp/comp401fall19/practice_exams/ For all of these sections, I keep receiving assertion errors stating that the actual values don&#39;t match with the expected values. However, for each of these, I am creating a MutablePixelArrayPicture, painting it with the Paint method, then returning the same Mutable object. Also, the paintOnePixel() test passes on my MutablePixelArrayPicture class. Does anyone know how this error could be occuring? I just don&#39;t understand how the way I am using it is different from the previous ways within a4 Novice. I keep receiving this error which I do not understand. My jUnit tests all pass.

When we call a paint method, we&#39;ll change a pixel or a rectangle/square to the according pixel. After this is done, do we need to blend the unchanged pixels to blend with the new pixel(s) or is the paint method just changing the pixel and not blending anything after?  is anyone seeing the lecture 10 slides on sakai? or is it just me?  how do you do a4 gradient without creating a new array (like in monochrome)?  I can&#39;t seem to locate directions for the paintOnePixel method. Am I missing something in the ReadMe file?       EDIT: This is with regards to the horizontal and vertical stack classes. Sorry about the confusion.   EDIT2: Nevermind, I just read the autograder results wrong. Whoops.  I&#39;m not positive if I&#39;m doing this method properly      my implementation looks like this for horizontal:      if x is greater than the (left pictures width-1), then rightpic = rightpic.paint(x,y,p) to account for immutable and mutable types, else leftpic = leftpic.paint(x,y,p), and then the this object is returned      What is wrong with this logic?      Also can I assume that for the rectangle and circle paint methods that they can paint both left/right and top/bottom paintings?  I am getting errors for Adept Tests 14-18. They stop when checking for component equality. I was wondering if anyone else had these issues and what they did to resolve them? I am unsure if there is something wrong with my blending?? I have tried setting the blending as a new pixel and then setting my array[i][j] to the new pixel? If someone could enlighten me, I&#39;d appreciate it! What is the difference between an error and failure in JUnit? Is an error something that will cause autograder to mark something as wrong? In an attempt to get rid of these Gradescope Errors that most likely had something to do with my A4 file location, I ended up deleting all of A4 and tried to redownload A4 completely to start new.    Gradescope error:      Screen_Shot_20190930_at_8.47.39_PM.png      Screen_Shot_20190930_at_8.47.34_PM.png       After wiping my A4 from eclipse/my computer still didn&#39;t work, as a last attempt I left the repository for A4, thinking that I could get access to it again from the link in the email. Now, when I click on the link to access the A4 assignment from the Sakai link or email link, I get a 404 Error Message.      Please let me know ASAP what I can do to be able to recommit to A4 and turn it into gradescope!         Thank you!  I know this should be mutable so I should be returning vertical or horizontal. However, the only constructor I have for them is one that needs two parts. How would I go about doing this?  I still can&#39;t see my implementations in git staging. I literally can&#39;t submit to gradescope if I don&#39;t figure it out, so help would be appreciated.  I am having trouble with coming up with a way to paint a specific rectangle within the given array. I have tried calculating the distances of (ax,ay) and (bx,by) to (0,0), but that did not seem to work. Am I going in the right direction? Thanks.      EDIT: Thank you! This worked!   I am having the same problem with paint one pixel in all of the adept picture classes as other people on here have.  The thing that has been referred to several times as the source of the error is referring/tying the new created picture to the original source, so when the new object is changed, so is the source. In my paint methods, I am creating new objects to pass the picture through the mutable pixel array class like so:   Picture pic = new MutablePixelArrayPicture(pixel_array);   I have also tried creating a new pixel array, feeding my values into that pixel array and initializing the new object with  that  but still no cigar.  (I also have all of my main class variables in the Horizontal, Vertical, Immutable, Gradient classes set as private final.)  This is the line of code in my test case that is failing.      When I added the null pointer exception, all the Adept Test Case failed. I&#39;m confused because for a vertical stack picture, shouldn&#39;t the Top and Bottom have the same *width,* not height???      Picture invalidVerticalStackPictureNullValueRight = new VerticalStackPicture(redImmutablePicture, \t\t\t\t\tyellowGradientPicture); \t\tfail(&#34;Left and right are not the same height.&#34;); \t\t} catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {  \t\t}         Here is the test that I am failing.      My method goes something similar to creating a pixel (p1) equal to blending the upper_left with the lower_left with a factor of y/height, then creating another pixel (p2) equal to blending the upper_right with the lower_right with a factor of y/height, then blending p1 with p2 by a factor of x/width, the factors were all cast to doubles too.      Any info is appreciated  I keep getting 2.7513 when the grader expects .2. I am using the formula :             new = Math.pow(old, (1.0/gamma));      I casted the whole thing to a double so it would pass the other tests. As far as I can tell, the pixel being passed into Gamma is a ColorPixel(0.2, 0.3, 0.25); Any tips?     I am stuck on the Novice test that tests for IllegalArgumentExceptions within the mutable pixel array constructor, specifically the one that tests for null columns. Can anyone please point me in the right direction to checking for null columns? Thank you!!   Hi! I was running the JUnit tests for my A4 Novice code but it keeps getting stuck on the testPartialOverlapPaintCircle(). Is there anyway I can fix this? It won&#39;t go through the rests of the tests because of this.      Edit: never mind, I figured it out!  My code for this is only one line that&#39;s the return statement. I&#39;m not sure if I need more, but I think one line can fit in everything you need.   The junit test is failing on line 123 (bolded area)   Picture source =  new MonochromePicture(5, 5, new GrayPixel(0.25)); \t\tsource = source.paint(0, 0, 1, 1, new GrayPixel(0.75)); \t\tPixelTransformation thresh050 = new Threshold(0.5); \t\tPicture xformed_picture = new TransformedPicture(source, thresh050); \t\tassertEquals(source.getWidth(), xformed_picture.getWidth()); \t\tassertEquals(source.getHeight(), xformed_picture.getHeight()); \t\tfor (int x=0; x&lt;source.getWidth(); x&#43;&#43;) { \t\t\tfor (int y=0; y&lt;source.getHeight(); y&#43;&#43;) { \t\t\t\tif (x &lt; 2 &amp;&amp; y &lt; 2) { \t\t\t\t\t  assertTrue(check_for_white(xformed_picture.getPixel(x, y)));   \t\t\t\t} else { \t\t\t\t\tassertTrue(check_for_black(xformed_picture.getPixel(x, y))); \t\t\t\t} \t\t\t} \t\t}   My guess is that there could be a problem with my ImmutablePixelArrayPicture, because I extended it for the TransformedPicture class.  I&#39;m calculating the pixel value in the getPixel method of Gradient Picture by blending top left pixel with bottom left corner and top left corner at the y value of the pixel of interest as follows:      topleft.blend(bottomleft, y / height).      I repeat for the top right and bottom right, then blend those 2 values together as       firstInRow.blend(lastInRow, x / width)      I cast my x and ys as doubles, and have tried height-1 and width -1, but am still failing the component equality tests beginning on line 526 in the adept tests. Any advice?  Hello,   I am currently trying to go through A4, but I am getting a collection of really confusing errors.      For one, almost half of my code is not passing because of stuff that should be getting thrown by my exceptions.      I still have errors like &#34;Expected exception attempting to get out of bounds pixel&#34;   when I have written IllegalArgumentExceptions for every relevant method, checking if x is less than 0 or higher than height/width, depending on which one it is. I&#39;m getting errors about null values not being accounted for too, when I am throwing NullPointerExceptions for each and every time I have a point as a parameter.   Beyond this, I have errors in other tests that seem to be comparing addresses of objects or something, and I have no idea what that is even attempting to refer to, so I have no idea how to troubleshoot it. Image of what I am talking about is below.          Am I missing something? I am really stressing out about this because I still need to write the Adept and Jedi code tonight and I am not even able to work on troubleshooting the actual issues in my algorithm for novice because I am being swamped by this.      Just tried changing the exceptions to illegal argument exceptions, nothing changed. Idk what is happening.  I pass jedi code in junit tests but not on the autograder? Is there a fix?  When, I run through my stuff through the tests, it says some of the getters aren&#39;t working:    Errors.png       Can someone explain why because I have been troubleshooting this, and I can&#39;t figure out what a potential error could be.  None of my picture implementations are showing up in the git staging area. The only things showing up are the original interfaces and pixel classes. Any idea on how to fix this?  We were told in recitation that we&#39;d be getting some practice material for the midterm coming on the 15th. When might that happen?  Waited in the line for over an hour, My Digital Hand said I was ready to be helped and to find  the instructor but everyone in the room was busy helping other people, after 10 minutes of waiting the website reset my hand back down. I&#39;m not sure if this was a bug or not but now I have to wait back in line. If someone could look into this so that it won&#39;t happen again that&#39;d be much appreciated.  Initially, I created a PictureImpl class for Novice, but then realized I didn&#39;t need it and deleted it.  Now my A4 grader is saying my code has 0% coverage. I tried deleting and recreating the grader in eclipse but now it still doesn&#39;t work.  Is there any other way I could fix this?  On the A4Grader on Line 71, theres a test to see if the columns are all the same height. So because of this, we can conclude that column = height. Also the first dimension of a 2d array would be height which also means the first index is columns. But wouldn&#39;t columns be indicative of width and not height? And wouldn&#39;t the first dimension of a 2d array be considered rows and height instead of columns and height?  The test does getPixel(-1, 1); which causes a runtime error like it is supposed to, but that runtime error crashes the test.  Me and several other students are waiting for an la for our cohort. Is someone going to be showing up or should we leave?    The input for the Vertical and Horizontal Picture classes are two Picture objects. I was thinking that because these two classes should be mutable, I could create a MutablePixelArrayPicture object and get height, width, etc from the pixel_array. But I don&#39;t see a way to make this possible since the MutablePixelArrayPicture constructors don&#39;t take in Picture objects. How would I be able to access, width, height,pixels in the two Picture objects?  I passed all the test on Gradescope included Novice and Jedi except Adept Test 14. It shows    Output: Test failed a4grader.A4AdeptTests.check_for_component_equality(A4AdeptTests.java:556) a4grader.A4AdeptTests.testImmutablePixelArrayPicturePaintOnePixel(A4AdeptTests.java:430)   Does anyone know how to solve this?  So every test for A4 Novice passes for me except for one particular part in testMutableArrayPictureConstructor2dPixelArray, where it&#39;s supposed to have an exception for when the pixel array includes null columns or null pixels. I&#39;ve run if statements such as if (value == null), if (value.equals(null)), if (null == value) but none of these have worked for the test so far. I&#39;m wondering if there is another way to check whether columns and pixels within the pixel array are null or if I&#39;m just having syntax errors because I&#39;m pretty confident the if statements above should work.  for gradient, do we still implement every paint method? Like for painting one pixel, do we leave all the other pixels blank and just paint the one what it would be if the whole thing was painted?  For the MonochromePicture constructor,   &#34;public MonochromePicture(int width, int height, Pixel value)&#34; . . .       First I check for non-positive height and width arguments.  Next, I check to see whether the value argument is null by using the following code.      if (value.equals(null)) {     throw new IllegalArgumentException(&#34;Illegal pixel input&#34;);  }       When I run only &#34;testMonochromePictureConstructor()&#34; in A4NoviceTests.java, the test fails due to a NullPointerException.  The errors occur at lines 50 and 46 of the a4 Pixel interface, which is where the following method is located . . .          default public boolean equals(Pixel other, double epsilon) {   return Math.abs(getIntensity() - other.getIntensity()) &lt; epsilon;  }         Do errors occur because null is treated as the &#34;other&#34; argument in this method, and because I cannot use getIntensity() on a null object?  If so, how to I check to see whether the value argument of my MonochromePicture is null?        I also fail the test when I try to use &#34;if (value == null).&#34;        Most of the other tests in A4NoviceTests.java also fail due to a NullPointerException.      Thanks.  For example, when the test passes in -1 as a parameter for the width, I am failing even though I am throwing an exception in the code for an illegal parameter. I am failing for other things, like when I have to test to see if the pixel array is null. I am definitely checking these things in my code, so what is causing the test to fail?  I completed all of my code to work with adept tests, but when I run JUnit tests every test fails and I get the error &#34;Cannot instantiate the type VerticalStackPicture&#34; and &#34;Cannot instantiate the type HorizontalStackPicture&#34;. Anyone else have this issue or know how to resolve this?      edit: if it helps, gradescope error says :   Test failed a4grader.A4AdeptTests.&lt;init&gt;(A4AdeptTests.java:46)  Hello,   I am confused on where I am supposed to implement the blend part of this class. I know the constructor is where I initialize my private fields and check for illegal argument exceptions, but I am not sure what method I am supposed to blend the pixels in. Thank you!  What exactly does it mean when you return a new picture object within paint methods? If the purpose of the paint method is to assign the pixel array at a certain index a color, returning a new picture object doesn&#39;t really make the most logical sense for me. For my paint methods, I&#39;ve been just returning &#34;new MutablePixelArrayPicture(pixelarray) and not sure if thats the right thing to return.   Im confused as to how exactly we are supposed to be implementing this class. Are we initializing a Pixel[][] inside the constructor with their respective pixel gradients?   So my original initialization for the pixel_array that is passed in for constructor1 isn&#39;t working. I&#39;ve tried using/not using the this. , setting the field to a diff/same name, and basically anything else but I can&#39;t seem to understand why I can&#39;t set the passed in array to my array I created as a field.       Without the array initialization, all my other tests that require the array are all failing. I included a screenshot of the constructor but blocked off the other coding for honor code reasons. Thanks            On Gradescope, all my tests keep failing line 33 on A4NoviceTests. After seeing what the line is, 33 to 40 is just initializing the Picture, so I&#39;m suspecting that my constructor is the issue.   Although, after checking through my constructors for MutablePixelArrayPicture, everything seems to be correct.   When a new MutablePixelArrayPicture is being called, I&#39;m creating a new pixel array according to the width and height and I&#39;m filling in the pixel array with the initial value.   Is there something else missing?  Hello, I recently resubmitted my code after committing it to github. I previously had points but after my most recent commit. I now receive an error message for each test. Although, my JUnit test still works in my eclipse. Also, I have tried to revert back to my previous committed code but that has not worked.    For novice, whenever we call blend for a Pixel, are we blending the method&#39;s Pixel by the factor and putting the blended Pixel into the appropriate index OR are we blending the Pixel within the array with the given Pixel and factor?      So in other words:   p.blend(p, factor)   OR   pixel_array[x][y].blend(p, factor)  Can anyone tell me what route to go in passing the partial circle test, I pass all other tests but this one and do  not know why my code wouldn&#39;t work.  The build path appears to be configured the same way my working A3 grader was, but there are errors when I try to run the Novice tests         The instructions for creating the immutablepixelarraypicture constructors are exactly the same as mutable. I passed the mutable constructor test but not immutable, and they are exactly the same. I also tried making immutable extend mutable and using the super keyword, but still don&#39;t pass the constructor test. Does anyone know why this is, or am I wrong to do it this way?  For MonochromePicture I copied the pixels into an array (using a for loop) so I could access them as x and y components. This doesn&#39;t work for Gradient because it doesn&#39;t say the value of the pixels so I have nothing to copy. How should I implement this method instead?  I&#39;m having trouble understanding what Monochrome Picture does.   So Monochrome Picture&#39;s constructor doesn&#39;t make a Picture/pixel_array (as per instructions) but instead relies on the paint methods to return a Picture that&#39;s modified but not the exact Monochrome Picture (because it&#39;s immutable).   So, when we&#39;re calling to paint a Monochrome Picture, would we just return a MutablePixelArrayPicture that is filled with the Monochrome Picture value but also has the specific Pixels within the pixel_array modified?  remember to double check the spreadsheet tomorrow for your cohort location and make sure you go to the right place! I know a couple of LAs including myself have switched locations from week to week So for each of the paint methods, we need to return a Picture object. I have a picture class in order to do this. But do MutablePixelArrayPicture and MonochromePicture need to extend the picture class? I have added this but I get a bunch of errors in the constructors so I don&#39;t know if its necessary or not. When I code for the paint methods that don&#39;t take in a factor, I make a method call to the paint methods that do take in a factor. Do we need to create a new picture object before we make this call or after? Or do we only need to create the picture object in the paint methods that take in a factor? I&#39;ve tried to do each but they either return null or return a different picture than what is correct.   Does this mean the factor of the blend? I am having a hard time understanding this. I have tried so many different methods and ways of understand this but I keep getting errors or an illegal factor. And now for some reason, I am getting a divide by zero error when I specifically set my code up to not do that or have a case where that happens.      Also, after putting a placeholder for this so I could continue working on Horizontal and Vertical, I was able to get those working (except for the PaintOnePixel tests, which I STILL have not gotten an official response from KMP or the TA team about after being told by multiple TAs it&#39;d be looked into) but when I change GradientPicture around to work on it, I get errors in the other functions&#39; tests for some reason, leading me to continue to believe that A4 Adept&#39;s JUnit is buggy.      Please respond and help me with this situation, I&#39;ve put so many hours into this assignment and have waited literal hours for TA office hours help for little to no results or progress in the assignment and work.      Thanks.        Hey guys, I’m still confused with the relationship between Pixel[][] pixel_array and MutablePixelArrayPicture.   So appreciated if someone can help me differentiate them!  Hi,   For some reason, whenever I check if the pixel_array is null or contains any null value in my constructor, the autograder will mark it as wrong. Am I doing something wrong here?  Also, this is a more general question in regards to the assignment, but I am having trouble with regards with the return for the default methods. I understand we can&#39;t necessarily create new methods, but how are we supposed to get the method to work properly?  My JUnit test for adept will only run the first test and then it stops.  It was working earlier today but now it isn&#39;t.  I tried deleting the A4 grader from eclipse and I went through the steps to add it again but it still is doing the same thing and I don&#39;t know why.  Just seeing if anyone knows how to fix this. Thanks!      It also won&#39;t let me debug since the JUnit isn&#39;t running.  Just for a sanity check, is upper_left [0][0] and upper_right[0][row length] or is it orientated another way?  I am getting all the test pass but I cannot pass Columns in picture are not all the same height. Exception should be thrown.   I have tried many things any ideas???  Can someone give me some advices about why this happened? I just think if the first one can pass then all of the following initializations should also pass. Thanks in advance!   I&#39;m not sure what it&#39;s asking us to do for this implementation. Can anyone explain?  I am having the same problem that some others are having with getting Immutable, Horizontal, and Vertical to pass the PaintOnePixel test. My paint methods in those classes create a new MutablePixelArrayPicture and then return the paint method called on it. All my other Adept tests pass as well as all my novice and jedi tests. What am I doing wrong? Everything seems to be working perfectly but I can&#39;t figure out this last part.   What would be a possible reason why gradescope would grade novice correct when I submitted it, but then grade it wrong when I submit the adepts? I didn&#39;t change anything in my novice code when I submitted my adept codes. They should all still be working correctly even if my adept is failing right?  I keep failing the novice test on line 75:      Line 75:     Picture invalidNullRow2dPixelArray = new MutablePixelArrayPicture(includesNullRowsPicture);      I understand this is supposed to throw an exception. I tried looping through the array at the 1st dimension and I tested this line myself and got an exception thrown when I executed. The auto grader isn&#39;t passing this test and everything is pushed properly to GitHub.      Anyone have any ideas?  For VerticalStack Picture and HorizontalStackPicture, all my tests are passing except for the PaintOnePixel() Test. They keep falling when the check-for_component_equality and I really can&#39;t figure out why. Can someone help me try to figure out how to write the paint method when it&#39;s just for one pixel?? Not sure where I&#39;m going wrong. I feel like my code should work since everything else is.   I followed the a3 grader steps to add the Junit tests to work for a4, and a4 is in the class path, but the line that imports a4 is giving me an error. How do I fix this?      Edit: This is the error message that pops up. I have tried hovering over and manually clicking &#34;fix project setup&#34; as well.       Screen_Shot_20190928_at_2.48.20_PM.png   I was having a problem with Adept where JUnit was failing in the constructor region, but I had to leave for a class. A LA that was passing through (who I forget the name of ) that was helping my LA on the problem, said that she would take a look at my github code and see if she could find the issue and message me through piazza.   I just wanted to let that LA that I came back to the help center after that class and I got it all figured out.  Thanks for all the help!  All my tests are passing except the PaintOnePixel tests for Immutable, Vertical, and Horizontal. I even have the PaintOnePixel for Gradient working. I find it strange that this easier test is failing but the harder ones are passing fine? All my novice tests passed 100% so I really do not understand what my problem is here. I know someone else who had the same problem. In the ReadMe, it says to &#34;encapsulate references to two Picture objects&#34;; does this mean these two objects should be the only thing encapsulated, or are we allowed to encapsulate additional variables (A 2d array, for example) as well? Is anyone else supposed to be in the General Cohort at 10:00 today? There&#39;s no one here.  What is the acceptable value of x and y? Are they supposed to be greater or equals to 0 or just greater than 0  Why are we expected red equals green here? According to the setup, the correct value should be 0.0 right? (See red underline in the pictures below)                 I am planning to create a new object in default methods (all of the paint methods) because most implementations are immutable, but how can I create a new object and clone pixel_array into it? Thanks in advance!  I added the JUnit tests the same way we added it for the last assignment, but I keep getting this:    Is anyone else getting this? Am I missing something?  Can someone explain why this is happening? It&#39;s not giving me a separate reason for all the objects failing but instead this &#34;Illegal factor&#34; exception, where it&#39;s not letting anything else pass or fail or anything. I had all my Novice stuff work fine with the factor checking. My JUnit file might be messed up but I&#39;m not sure...   Normally when a test fails in the autograder it will tell you which one it was. However, when I submitted my A4 I get this message for all the Novice and Adept tests:      Output: Test failed a4grader.A4NoviceTests.&lt;init&gt;(A4NoviceTests.java:33)  Output: Test failed a4grader.A4AdeptTests.&lt;init&gt;(A4AdeptTests.java:32)      What does this mean? I thought it meant that there was a problem with something on line 33, ie before any of the tests are even encountered. However, I was able to put all the code before the tests from A4NoviceTests into a separate file and it ran just fine. If it&#39;s worth mentioning, this doesn&#39;t occur for the Jedi tests (1 and 2 passed, 3 did not but it told me which test was failed).  I am having a lot of trouble with my Paint function in my Immutable Picture Class editing the original Array. I have tried to separately copy every pixel over to a new array with a for loop and have tried using .clone() but neither seemed to work. Is anyone else having trouble with this?? Help please!!  I&#39;ve been having problems with my ShortButFairDispatcher for quite a while now. I&#39;ve been to office hours multiple times and also talked to KMP about it but I still haven&#39;t figured it out. My code is currently passing the first 3 tests for ShortButFairDispatcher, but failing at the fourth test with a value of -11.89999... (expected value is 83.4). A picture of all the tests, errors, instructions, and code will be attached to this post. If anyone could give me some advice/help, it would be greatly appreciated!      Tests:             errors:          ShortButFairDispatcher code:   (*Instructions for ShortButFairDispatcher*     This dispatcher should choose the driver that is closest to the client&#39;s position but without considering the last five drivers chosen (you can assume that there will be more than five available drivers). In other words, if your dispatcher first chooses DriverA, then the next four times that the dispatcher is asked to choose a driver, DriverA should not be eligible for being chosen. )       On lines 126 and 127 of A4NoviceTests.Java the following lines exist:    assertEquals (2, randomMutablePicture.getWidth());    assertEquals (4, randomMutablePicture.getHeight());       However, earlier in the file the following declarations are made:      Pixel[][]randomPicture={ {blue,randomColor,randomColor,red},{green,red,green,randomColor}};   Picture randomMutablePicture = new MutablePixelArrayPicture(randomPicture);      Based on the randomPicture double array, isn&#39;t the width 4 and the height of that double array 2? You would be stacking two 1x4 arrays to make an array with height two and width 4? Why are the JUnit test assertions written the other way?                on like 316 of the novice tests, it checks that p and result are equal. parray[0][0] is red, but result is changing that to blue. so why should they be equal?  Does anyone have an idea on how to realize the other approach to achieving an immutable method?  I am a bit confused as to what width and height are as compared to x and y. If we access a pixel with    pixel_array[x][y]   then should we have that 0 &lt;= x &lt;= height and 0 &lt;= y &lt;= width because there are x rows (the height) and y columns (width)?     If one of the provided coordinate for the function is out of bounds, should the method paint as much as possible or should it throw an error? Ie for the circle one, if cx and cy give the coordinates of the bottom-right corner, should the program paint a quartercircle?      EDIT: I see now that it says any value for cx, cy should be allowed, but what about the one with (ax,ay) and (bx,by)  I&#39;m failing JUnit tests. How should we deal with the pixel of different height? Like:   Pixel[][] differentHeightPicture = { { red, blue, green }, { red, green, blue }, { red, green } };   I tried to throw illegal argument if the pixel_array[0].length is different with pixel_array[2].length, but this would cause a disaster since many JUnit tests do not provide a pixel array has the third row. Thanks!  Our constructors for the immutable object are the same as the ones in mutable, right? It&#39;s only the paint methods that different so that they do not edit the private &#34;pixels&#34; array field directly? How can we implements any default methods in Picture? When we call the paint method, we are supposed to edit the elements of the pixel_array. However, we don&#39;t have access to the pixel_array in the interface. Can we just create a getter for it in the interface?Hi Katherine,      My name is Emma and I am in your 608 recitation. Are you available to meet tomorrow? I am really confused about A4 as I have zero experience with pixels and graphics. I was wondering if we could meet and go over what I have so far so I can get started and understand what the heck I am doing.  Thanks so much, Emma For the pixels other than the four corners, does it mean that we should blend the pixels in four corners separately using function Blend(p, factor), as we can only blend two pixels in one time, like &#34;the initial pixel blend upper-left first, then the result of previous blending blend upper-right pixel, and so on&#34;? So what&#39;s the initial pixel (that before all blending processes) should be, as we should use one pixel to blend another?  From this instruction, it seems like I should initialize the pixel array as [width][height],   meaning width represents the number of rows for a picture      The first dimension of pixel_array is the width and the second is the height. In other words, pixel_array.length will be the width of the picture and pixel_array[0].length will be the height of the picture.        From this instruction, seems like   height represents the number of rows for a picture      The constructors should throw an IllegalArgumentException if any of the parameters are null or if the geometry of the objects provided is not compatible (i.e., if the  heights  of left and right differ for HorizontalStackPicture or if the  widths  of top and bottom differ for VerticalStackPicture).       Do I misunderstand these statements or the instructions are wrong? I&#39;m a little confused about public Picture paint(int x, int y, Pixel p, double factor) { I know we have to blend p with something but I&#39;m not sure what the other pixel is supposed to be. Where do we set the color of gray to every newly initialized pixels   Are the last 2 lines of the questions requiring us to create another 2 constructors for the last 2 lines of requirement? Or that 2 lines are the general instructions about the constructor?  I am a little bit lost in the question and looking for some explanation of this question.   Hi everyone! I just wanted to point out that there are still plenty of cohort slots that are still open (and several cohorts with no one signed up). If you want to be a part of one but no time works for you, please let us know.       Quick reminder of what cohorts are:    Cohorts offer you a chance to regularly meet with an LA to get help on anything ranging from assignments to CS career questions.  You essentially will meet with the same LA and 6 or 7 other students in the class once a week for an hour.  Cohorts are optional, but if you choose to be a part of one, attendance is encouraged.  They won&#39;t be a part of your grade, and are simply meant to be a resource to help you in this class. If you are interested, use the link below to sign up.       https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AcBjMXOupw8XXfZ05RNZZPXfVG_64n0wZEnGQdpVtSc/edit?usp=sharing   How do you know which methods can be default? I don&#39;t really understand the concept.      Is it about getters and setters? Are those the methods that are default?  Is this only going to differ from the mutable one by the pixel_array being private instead of public? I guess this will also change how we implement the paint methods since we will have to create and return a new MutablePixelArrayPicture. correct?  When you are painting in a monochrome picture, are you changing the entire picture to be the new Pixel or only the specified coordinate? I can&#39;t tell if monochrome pictures are supposed to STAY monochrome no matter what method is called or not.  Since the Pixel interface&#39;s blend function already checks for factor&#39;s legitimacy, do I have to recheck every time a factor is used in a method for the picture objects?  For the mutable array, it simply means we can edit the pixel/pixel array parameter directly, right? And for immutable, we are not allowed to directly change the pixel array values?  I&#39;m so confused: when we are creating a 2-dimensional array(traditionally), shouldn&#39;t it be like   int[][] a = new int [number of rows][number of columns] ?   And in A4 novice, why do we need to flip this rule? Does it mean that we need to think in the opposite way when encounter 2-dimensional arrays in the future?  The interfaces Pixel and Picture  aren&#39;t marked as interfaces on the package explorer tab, meaning I can&#39;t implement them when making new classes for A4 Novice. When I try to create a new class that implements, for example, the Picture interface, the Picture interface does not come up as a suitable interface to implement. How do I fix this? I was able to use this method of creating new classes in A3 with no issues.  req = new RideRequestImpl(new PositionImpl(25,0), new PositionImpl(25,10));  c = new CompletedRideImpl(req, d);  assertEquals(25, c.getWaitTime());  assertEquals(2.0*10, c.getPrice(), 0.005);         I am failing this part of code. I think the ride time should be 25 instead of 20, since the distance is 10. Can someone help me. Thank you!  For A4 Novice, one of the paint methods for Picture requires (cx, cy, radius, p) and uses cx and cy as the center point and filling in each Pixel within the specified radius as p. I&#39;m wondering if we&#39;re making the area that&#39;s filled with Pixel p in the shape of a circle or square?  I can&#39;t seem to firgure out what Novice Test 4 is testing for.      I have written test code to make sure that I am throwing exceptions for edge cases being input for first name, last name, and vehicle.      The setter also changes the vehicle instance in my driver class.         After this past assignment, we&#39;ve seen a bunch of posts with screenshots of code. DO NOT DO THIS. It&#39;s an honor court violation. If you can&#39;t explain it well enough in words or a few lines of code, Piazza is not the place to ask - go to OH.  I wrote ShortButFairDispatcher by taking my ShortestWaitDispatcher code &amp; adding an array list that keeps track of every driver      Every iteration of the for loop checks the available driver to make sure they&#39;re not in the 5 most recent indeces of the array list       This method failed the first time because the starting length of the array list was 0, so in desperation I added 6 dummy drivers to the list so subtracting 1/2/3/4/5 from the size doesn&#39;t create an error      However the result of this code has the exact same error (expected 78.1 / actual 79.4) that it would if I just copied my ShortestWaitDispatcher code exactly      Please help            I have an ArrayList to keep track of the past drivers but how do implement that to not pick the drivers in my ArrayList?  What changes after the 10th test that would cause this?  Line 211,    assertEquals(4, cr1.getWaitTime());   is failing because it expects the wait time to be 4 but the output is 6      I have checked my getManhattanDistanceTo method and my getWaitTime method several times but I can&#39;t find anything wrong with either of them      All of my other novice tests are passing, please help         My simulation values are wrong but the same as the values someone was getting in a comment on &#64;172      My simulation test is outputting all of the correct values but tests Novice 9 and Novice 13 are failing.      Has anyone encountered this, any ideas?  When I test the ShortWaitDispatcher, I keep failing all the tests bc my code keeps giving me negative values (i.e. instead of 64.1 i get   -10.899999999999999). I passed both Novice and Jedi so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s any of my price, cost, or profit methods. I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s going wrong with my code.         I passed Jedi for this assignment, however because I needed to modify the code in Simulation, it is affecting the tests for Adept. While my ShortestWait test was passing before Jedi, it now breaks when the test tries to create a new Simulation...how should I approach fixing this? Any help is appreciated, thank you!  All my novice tests are passing but when commit and push to github, i don&#39;t get any points in gradescope. Why is this? I did try to modify a couple of things in github but think everything should be running smoothly. All tests are passing.  Guys just giving a little hint because I was stuck debugging Adept1 (ShortButFairDriver) for days having the same error, passing all the tests but the last one. You have to make sure you always have to have 5 drivers in your list of previously chosen driver. In other words, when you are going to enter the 6th chosen driver, is when you delete the driver in position 0. Good luck.  Hi, I&#39;m having some trouble with this failed test:    a3grader.NoviceTests.vehicleMoveTest(NoviceTests.java:120)   My problem is here:       When I include vehiclePosition = p; in my code, I get the incorrect output (test 12), but I get test 6 correct. If I comment it out, I get the correct output, but test 6 is incorrect. I&#39;ve been fiddling with this for hours, and I don&#39;t know how to get both correct. Thank you for any input.  So I am trying to write my adept code for ShortButWait, and this happens.   I get through the first two assertEquals just fine, but after this, it spits out a number that is wildly off base.    Is there something I am missing about this code? Because as far as I can tell, all I would need to do is run the waitTime code, find the lowest one, and store the Driver that is associated with the lowest one unless I am missing something major. I also do not  completely  get what the tests are testing for to begin with, so that makes it harder than usual to troubleshoot.  Out of the 20 outputs that the grader is checking from ShortButFairDispatcher, 19 are exactly correct but 1 is wrong. It&#39;s the 6th from last, it should be 84.2 but I&#39;m getting 82.9... any suggestions on what to try? I am having some trouble writing the code for the complete method in the RideRequest class and for the getWaitTime method in the CompletedRide class. From my understanding, in the complete method if isComplete is false we are supposed to make it true, make a completedRide object, and then update the position of the driver&#39;s vehicle to the client&#39;s position and then the destination position. Once that happens though I keep getting errors on novice tests 10 and 12 because my getWaitTime result is not what it should be because it is no longer calculating the distance between the client and the driver&#39;s original position. I think I&#39;m just confused on how to save the driver&#39;s position at the time when the request was made and then how to pass that into the getWaitTime method.   hopefully my question makes sense!! would love some help Something has gone horribly wrong with my repository and I have no idea how to solve it. Would like to meet with someone ASAP.   EDIT: I removed everything in this post after reading the recent announcement.  Hi, I&#39;ve been stuck on this for a while, and when I run the SimulationTest, I almost get the correct output. These are the values I get:   Ride 0: -10.60 Ride 1: 36.70 Ride 2: 151.10 Ride 3: 22.50 Ride 4: 81.60 Ride 5: 70.40 Ride 6: 51.10 Ride 7: 50.00 Ride 8: -13.10 Ride 9: 49.70 Total Profit: 489.40      As you can see, I am 50 cents off from the correct total profit, and I can see that Ride 8 is the incorrect output. However, I&#39;m not quite sure where the error could be to just be impacting that output. Any thoughts? Thank you for any input.  I&#39;m having trouble with understanding the complete and getIsComplete methods in the RideRequest interface.      Here are the descriptions of them:    * getIsComplete()  * Returns true if this request has been completed, false if not.  * A new RideRequest starts off as not completed and becomes completed  * if the complete method (see below) is invoked.  *   * complete(Driver driver)  * If the RideRequest has not yet been completed, the method should:  * - update the request to indicate that the request has been completed,  * - create a CompletedRide object that captures information  * about the completed ride (see CompletedRide interface)  * - move the vehicle of the driver to the position of the client and   * then move the vehicle to the destination of the ride,  * - and finally return the CompletedRide object.      getIsComplete() depends on complete(). But in that case, what determines if the rideRequest has been completed yet/what &#34;invokes&#34; the complete() method? In other words, I&#39;m confused about what the condition should be in complete (Driver driver).        Hello, I was able to get past errors involving my field array but now I&#39;m not getting the proper output. I believe this may have to do with the syntax of my field, but I am completely lost now. I have my ShortWaitDispatcher() method&#39;s math working, so it&#39;s not my method of deducing the smallest wait time, but it has to do with my way of determining the last five drivers. I was able to pass the first test, but the second test expected 83.4 and my output was -11.8999999999999. Please help   Hello,   I am currently going through the A3 assignment, but after implementing all of the code for novice, my output on the test is incorrect, and I cannot figure out why.   my output is this.       I will update if I figure out what has gone wrong, but I just thought I would ask in case anyone else has experienced something similar.      EDIT:   I fixed my manhattan method (it had the order wrong) and did not let wait time be influenced by the position change, and now my output is this. This still is not right and I am struggling to figure out what to troubleshoot.       Edit: I think there is something wrong with my manhattan distance, because within my junit tests, I get a result of 4 when I should be getting 6. However, I do not see what is wrong with it. This is what I wrote:    The defaultMethodsTest also cannot seem to find this method, so clearly something is going wrong. I really cannot tell what though.   EDIT: I&#39;M SO SORRY. I was accidentally returning x again from my getY instead of y. Sorry for coming to you all for this, I was just getting stressed. All the tests pass now.  I&#39;ve been looking at the second adept part (ShortButFairDispatcher()) for like 2 hours, and I can&#39;t figure out how I&#39;m expected to save the result of a past execution of the method. I even went ahead and finished Jedi and I still can&#39;t get this. I tried making a field array for storing the last 5 drivers but I don&#39;t know how I can have it be a &#34;universal&#34; array that will stay the same upon each execution  When I test the short wait dispatcher, I receive a failed test for the 5th entry in the ridelog because it is expecting 230.00 and my code gives 229.3, but when I calculate it myself with a calculator it also gives me 229.3. I&#39;m unsure if this is a rounding problem or something else because it calculates correctly for the others?          Hi everyone, my ShortestWaitDispatcher passes the first few tests in the autograder however when it reaches line 25, it breaks. Is there anyway to figure out where my code is going wrong? I was trying to compare how my code got to it&#39;s &#34;actual&#34; result but I can&#39;t figure out the error if we don&#39;t know the positions that the grader is using.   what does it mean by this? does it mean the last 5 drivers checked for the shortest distance in the array?  All my novice Junit stuff is passing but when i push to gradescope its not. Any ideas as to why?    I&#39;m getting errors in the A3 grader folder even though I made no changes to it. I tried to re-clone the repository, but it&#39;s not replacing the old code in eclipse even after I deleted the folder in my finder.  I copied and pasted the files from GitHub too and I’m still getting errors. How can I start from scratch again/fix the errors in the code for the a3 grader?  I cannot get my basicRideRequestCompleteTest() to to be true because it says cr1 isn&#39;t equal to cr2, which most likely has to do with how my riderequestimpl&#39;s complete() method checks for a completed ride. Idk how what I have isn&#39;t right but any help is appreciated.  Every test case for my ShortButFair Dispatcher works except for one; it keeps throwing this error:      org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: expected: &lt;138.2&gt; but was: &lt;188.0&gt;;     My calculated profit (188) isn&#39;t equal to the expected profit (138.20). I don&#39;t see why this error only occurs for this one case, because all of the other ones are working. Any idea what could be causing this?    Hi! Everything is working in the entire code except for this one thing in Novice: assertEquals(cr1, cr2) Can someone explain why it is not working and what I am doing wrong. for the last step, when I try to right click on a3 grader package and click on &#34;Run As&#34; , the only option that I can run it as is &#34;1 Java Application&#34;    How do I fix this?  My code fails on the 18th adept shortbutfairdispatcher test. It returns 34.4 when 35.7 is expected. I have no idea why it is failing so many tests in. It obviously works correctly for the vast majority of the tests. Did anyone else have a similar issue?  I was trying to follow all the steps of creating jUnit test as it was shown in recitation, however, when I&#39;m uploading my project with jUnit test package, package org.junit.jupiter.api is not recognized by the GradeScope:   I see following message on Gradescope, when there is package with my jUnit test   submission/src/JUnitTesting/testRides.java:4: error: package org.junit.jupiter.api does not exist import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*; ^ submission/src/JUnitTesting/testRides.java:5: error: package org.junit.jupiter.api does not exist import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test; ^ submission/src/JUnitTesting/testRides.java:20: error: cannot find symbol &#64;Test   I have the following imports for my JUnit test case:   import a3.*;   import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;   import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;      For comparison, we had the following imports for JUnit test for Calculator in this week&#39;s recitation:   import calculator.*;   import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;   import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;      On my laptop, jUnit works without any issues. Mentioned above error happens only in Gradescope. I have to delete my jUnit test case file, to make sure that Gradescope grades my project correctly.      Is there a way to fix it?         I&#39;ve tried deleting the repository &amp; the import from Eclipse and then downloading them again, same result      I believe this prevents Gradescope from grading the assignment  I have the following code in PositionImpl:      public int getManhattanDistanceTo(Position p)  {   if (p == null)  {   throw new RuntimeException(&#34;Position provided has no value.&#34;);  }  int xDistance = Math.abs(p.getX() - this.getX());  int yDistance = Math.abs(p.getY() - this.getY());  return xDistance &#43; yDistance;  }      When junit checks p for null it misses a branch. I have the same thing to check for null input everywhere else in my code, and this is the only place where it doesn&#39;t get covered. What can I try to make junit cover the exception throwing?  I am having trouble understanding the syntax for the default test methods. I wrote a default void isDefault method within the interface that gives the throw RunTimeException. But after writing it in the interface, I am not sure how to test for it within my class.    Thank you!  I had duplicate files in my github for some reason and could not push from eclipse so I messed around a bit kinda following instructions from previous posts, deleted and recreated my local repo, and now when I&#39;m trying to push it says &#34;push without head not currently supported&#34;.   Whenever I upload to gradescope it doesn&#39;t go through my code and the error says &#34;failed to discover tests&#34;  Hi i keep getting this error after attempting to run my code through the autograder. It appears that my classes aren&#39;t being synced with the program despite following the correct GitHub process.       WARNING: TestEngine with ID &#39;junit-vintage&#39; failed to discover tests java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: a3/Position      Please advise what I can do to properly have my code graded versus just receiving a compilation error  For some reason, all of my code is working fine except for the RuntimeExceptions. As an example for DriverImpl          I&#39;m throwing exceptions the same way in all of my other implementations but they are still failing, any ideas?  Do we graded on the style of our code.       I feel like KMP mentioned it somewhere, and there&#39;s a code style guide, but I don&#39;t know where it would play into our grade because of the autograder.   When I run the JUnit 5 Tests in Eclipse it shows that all of my tests are passing without any issues. However, when I upload my code to Gradescope it is giving me 0/10. Can someone help, please?    When I try to run my ShortButFair code in the JUnit tests, I pass ShortestWait but my code breaks at line 44:             Can someone please explain what this means?   I am having trouble with the getMileage method. Right now I have these two line of code in my getMileage() method:    totalMileage &#43;= position.getManhattanDistanceTo(position);  return totalMileage;   With totalMileage initialized to zero in the constructor. I know the first line of code is returning zero because the distance between one position and the same position is zero; however, I am confused as to where the second position is supposed to come from. Thanks in advance for any help!  Is it possible to get an extension in the assignment? I have been working on it since posted but issues after issues every time I run my test classes, and for some reason, I am getting correct outputs for the novice as well as ShortWaitDispatch.   Is there any tutor that is going to be available on the weekend at school? I am still having issues with my a3.  assertEquals(20, c.getWaitTime()); -- Failing     How are we supposed to update the vehicle position but not the waiting time?     In my moveToPosition method, I do something like position = p; so when I call waitingTime the position gets updated there as well so it gets computed incorrectly.          Any thoughts?   assertEquals(dest_pos, v.getPosition()) -- Failing     I am having trouble trying to understand when the vehicle position is supposed to update to the final destination because the methods do not say like where to update them or implement them.          Which part of my A3 Adept Short But Fair code could go wrong here? I passed all the other test except this&#xff1f;    I used 2 array lists to store the available driver and driver who have already been assigned in the last 5 orders. But something is still going wrong         Can anyone offer any thought about why I passed first several test for shortWaitDispactcher but gradually deviated from the correct answer? Does the shortWaitDispatcher class only need us to find the driver with shortest distance and return that driver?  Many of the A3 autograder tests that I failed, I failed because of the exception tests.  Does anybody know where, and in what format, I should throw these exceptions?  I think I&#39;m getting the correct output for the shortest wait dispatcher (1230.80) and when I run AdeptTests in the a3 grader it passes with no errors or failures, but I&#39;m still not passing Adept Test 1 on Gradescope. Since a3 grader should essentially be what gradescope tests us on, does anyone know why this would be happening?  When both driver_pos and clientPosition are (0,0), why there will be a NullPointerException for waitTime?   Seems like getManhattanDistanceTo() will return null, which should not occur.      How can I resolve this problem?   For the ShortButFair dispatcher, how do you get which were the last 5 drivers that were dispatched?  Please...I don&#39;t want to experience this again...Thanks very much!!  Did anyone pass advancedRideRequestCompleteTest? How can the mileage be the same 10 after completing second ride?  I&#39;m still failing a few JUnit tests and the defaultMethods test doesn&#39;t make any sense. I haven&#39;t seen any &#34;default&#34; properties of methods. Can anyone explain how it works?  If you plan to answer, please read in entirety.   I&#39;ve browsed Piazza and looked at all available solutions for this, and I am still coming up short.      I already made a new CompletedRide object in Riderequest, and here is the code for that:       II am aware that I need to use the initial driver position for this new CompletedRide, but for some reason it still wasn&#39;t using its initial position despite me moving the driver after I made the new object. Therefore, I created a variable to hold that initial position in CompletedRideImpl, which is this:    anotherCompPic.PNG    Since I&#39;ve taken double measures to hold the driver&#39;s initial position, I literally have no idea what else is wrong.   I have looked into the NoviceTests, tracked my driver positions, and for some reason, at this step, my waitTime is still being calculated from the driver&#39;s position after moving instead of their initial position.      Just for reference, this is the error:   advancedRideRequestCompleteTest()   expected &lt;4&gt; was &lt;6&gt;      I know what the issue is, I just have no idea how to fix it.      Please give me your valuable insight!  I used the tester code and everything is working except for the ones that test with null values. I had runtime exceptions but it doesnt seem like they are working. I&#39;m not sure what I am doing wrong since I did it like we did in the example code in class.  If we can&#39;t make it to our regular recitation time, is it okay if we show up to a different section? Who would we need to get in touch with about that? Also what are the names of the head LAs; I can&#39;t seem to find that anywhere.  For correctly calculate the Wait time, we need the Clientposition where driver pick up the client and also the position of the end of last order. To  record the position of last order, I add a position attribute. Is this way allowed? I just think it may be diffeerent from the way that KMP wants us to do.  I just finished a3 adept, and wanted to upload it to gradescope as insurance.  I have not yet attempted a3 Jedi.  However, I got a 10/10 on the assignment.  Just wanted to make you aware.  I just followed the instruction on sakai to run the JUnit5 Grader, but the eclipse showed the error in the picture. How can I handle that?       NoClassDefFoundError.jpg   Why my JUnit Test in getWaitTime marked me wrong? Is there any factor that I missed?     Does anyone know how to make grader work in IntelliJ? I add JUnit 5.3 and a3-project to dependencies, but I get &#34;cannot resolve symbol&#34; error.  will the auto grader be up before Friday. We may need to go to office hours if we find out our code is incorrect.  Just curious:    Why is there a question mark on every implementation class?  How do you even begin thinking about ShortButFairDispatcher? Doesn&#39;t the Dispatcher implementations only get called each time the Simulation calls it? So how can it remember the previous drivers? Just looking for a push in the right direction.  What does it mean when it says in the complete() instructions to &#34;move the vehicle of the driver to the position of the client and then move the vehicle to the destination of the ride&#34;? Isn&#39;t that redundant when I can just move the the vehicle directly to the destination without moving it to the client first? Or am I misreading something? My simulation is all messed up but I am 99% certain all my implementations and interfaces are fine except here, where it seems unclear about how this method works.      Thank you  I&#39;m getting an error to do with referencing a non-static object with a static method. I&#39;m trying to get the wait time but when I use the manhattan distance method it&#39;s giving me this static error. I used it earlier with no problem (for getRideTime) but now it&#39;s giving me this error.      Thank you.  Do the absences for recitation need to be excused? I know we have to attend 9 of the 12, but to not have points deducted from our recitation attendance grade do they have to be excused?   I&#39;ve been stuck trying to implement getWaitTime() in the CompletedRiderImpl class. I duplicated getManhattanDistanceTo in the CompletedRiderImpl class and modified it to take 2 Position class parameters. What I can&#39;t figure out is how to get around this &#34;can&#39;t make static reference to non-static method&#34; error.      public int getWaitTime() {          return getManhattanDistanceTo(VehicleImpl.getPosition(), RideRequestImpl.getClientPosition());              // The error is &#34;Cannot make a static reference to the non-static method getPosition() from the type VehicleImpl&#34;     }  Does anyone have the simulation results of ShortestWaitDispatcher and ShortbutFairDispatcher ?    Are we supposed to have different classes for each of the different dispatcher implementations? In this dispatcher, how do we decide which driver to take the order after removing the closest driver who has already had an order less than 4 order before?  Can someone explain what we need to return for complete (Driver driver) in RideRequest.java? Do we need to return the complete(driver)?   I still don&#39;t have my A3 on gradescope.   Should we declare the initial value of mileage of each car to 0 since no information mentioned about how to access the total mileage except getMileage() ? The comment in Vehicle showed the getMileage is to retrieve the total distance the vehicle has traveled up to now but I don&#39;t how the method could retrieve it.  How are getCost() and getPrice() for a completed ride supposed to be computed? I don&#39;t see any instructions on how the rides are supposed to be priced.  Is there anyway for me to check what the properties should be?  Such as the actual wait time, ride time, cost etc...   I seem to have a logic issue and I am not getting the same profit values that are posted in novice?  Or can we just get rid of that bit?  How do I know if the request has been completed? I tried to get the answer by getProfit(), but there seems no way to retrieve that data. Is there any body can give me a hint please? Thanks! :)  Before the correction note I always got the intended output. Without moving driver to client and then to destination. However after I did what the correction suggested I get this output. I wonder if someone else has the same problem?

Hey everyone,      I&#39;m Max Nabokow, a freshman majoring in CS. I have been developing iOS apps for about a year now, and I plan to continue that in college, hoping to release an app to the App Store every semester. Because more brains can come up with more ideas and get more work done, I would like to start an  app development team  here at UNC. Are you interested? Maybe YOU are exactly the person I am looking for!      Do you have experience in    iOS development using  Swift ?   Back-end  development for mobile applications?   UI/UX  design?  Graphic design?       If you answered any of those questions with yes and you want to work on something other than COMP 401 homework, go ahead and email me (  mnabokow&#64;unc.edu  ) and/or DM me on Instagram ( &#64;max.nabokow ). I am hoping to build a  3-6 people  team of enthusiastic designers and developers, so please reach out if you are interested! We will also be working together with the UNC AppLab, which should be a great resource for us.   As of now, I do not have a specific app idea for this semester, so there will also be potential for you all to have a say in that. Although I have not done any Android development yet, we might consider going cross-platform as well.       Really looking forward to this!       Thank you,   Max Nabokow  What content will pop quizzes cover? Like everything we have discussed in class?  Just wanted to ask if A3 will be released soon.  How does late homework submission work?      For example i submitted A2 novice and A2 adept on time (7/10 on gradescope). Just got done with A2 jedi and submitted for 10/10 on gradescope (the HashMap utility is what I ended up using to keep track of the meals and the ingredients in each meal).       How many point are taken off for the late submission?   When will be the proper time to show my codes for a previous assignment to my class fellows? Say if someone wants to discuss A2 with me,  when can I just show him/her my entire assignment codes   *TL;DR*  We are excited to offer conceptual help in the Learning Lab! The Lab is open from 5-7 Tuesday-Thursday.  Have you ever waited in Office Hours for help on a conceptual question or been intimidated to ask a question in your large recitation section? If so, we have a solution for you! The Learning Lab is a new initiative from the CS Department to provide accessible and collaborative assistance on understanding key concepts from introductory CS courses, including: 110, 283, 290, 380, 401, 410, and 411. We are excited to offer this resource in addition to the traditional Office Hours and recitations that already occur!   *What is the Learning Lab?*  The Learning Lab is designed to be your one-stop shop for conceptual help. A typical Learning Lab session will involve a group of TAs discussing material from lecture and answering questions in a small group session. We will NOT help you on any assignments or labs in the Learning Lab, but it is a great place to reinforce your understanding of material and work with other students in a smaller setting.   *Why Should You Care?*  The Learning Lab closes the gap between the wait times for one-on-one help in Office Hours and the daunting group sizes of recitation. By attending the Learning Lab, you will have many opportunities to meet other students taking the same classes as you are and guarantee that there will be a set time in the week that you can reinforce material from lecture with your TAs.   *How Do I Attend?*  Simply come to FB007 during the Learning Lab hours of operation. Each week, the general hours will be from 5:00-7:00PM on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.  I had to miss class today, and I&#39;m wondering if KMP gave any further update on A3? I know he announced yesterday on Sakai that if he didn&#39;t have the assignment posted by class time on the 10th that he would adjust the deadline- did he say anything further in class? Just wondering, I know the link hasn&#39;t been posted yet.       Thanks y&#39;all!  I cannot find any dates for the quizzes on the syllabus. Are these announced?  So I submitted my A2 assignment last night on time and got 8/10 and could not figure out how to get full credit. But today I worked on it again and figured it out for 10/10 but submitted it late. I am wondering if my late penalty will make my grade anything less than an 8/10? Which was my original grade for finishing on time.   Does anyone know where I can find the contact information (e-mail addresses specifically) of the head LAs (the ones who teach the recitation sections)? I feel like there should be a page with that information somewhere but I cannot for the life of me find it. Thanks!  For A2 Adept, I am getting a rounding error when I try using String.format(&#34;%.2f, value).  I have the price initialized as a double at 0 each time in the loop, then i add ounces * price for each ingredient in the roll.  For some test cases i get a value 0.01 more than the expected output.    Eclipse won&#39;t run my code. How do I fix this?       For A2 novice, I try to keep track of the name of the ingredient with the highest / lowest calorie per dollar using a String variable and then use this String variable (thinking it is updating with a for loop I have running calculations after I have initialized that variable) for the print job at the end of the program. Whenever it prints, however, that variable shows up not being updated and shows up with whatever value I initialized it with. I then figured that that had to do with String variables being immutable and so tried using an array type instead, updating its given indexes with the string variables through the for loop as it compares the respective calorie per dollar numbers , but this had the same result of printing whatever the array was initialized to have at those given indices. Just was wondering if anyone knew of a way to hold a string value under a given string variable name but be able to update the value later on (or how else maybe to go about the problem). (by the way, I am using a class for ingredients with each instance of the ingredient having all of the fields you would think as well as a calculated calories per dollar variable for each instance--- maybe that has something to do with it) Thanks  when will assignment 3 be posted? Whenever I try to run A2 I get this error. I&#39;m not sure how to get rid of it, any help or suggestions?   84Exception in thread &#34;main&#34; java.util.InputMismatchException \tat java.base/java.util.Scanner.throwFor(Scanner.java:939) \tat java.base/java.util.Scanner.next(Scanner.java:1594) \tat java.base/java.util.Scanner.nextInt(Scanner.java:2258) \tat java.base/java.util.Scanner.nextInt(Scanner.java:2212) \tat a2.A2Novice.main(A2Novice.java:19) I got an array list thats being declared as this   ArrayList&lt;String&gt; order = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();   and I&#39;m using a while loop to add the next scanned item to the ArrayList order.   while (!(scan.next().equals(&#34;EndOrder&#34;))) { \torder.add(scan.next()); }   Although, when I provide the input and type &#34;EndOrder&#34; the console doesn&#39;t seem to do anything and the console says&lt;terminated&gt;   On Gradescope, one of the tests says its a NoSuchElementException issue. What does this exception mean specifically?  what are you all doing to keep track of the ingredient names and ounces? I tried to make arrays in a for loop to collect the inputs, but I&#39;m not sure how I could access the array values in my while loop at the end that accepts the orders. (since the initial arrays would disappear after the for loop ends. Another reason I didn&#39;t understand is because the number of ingredients can change for each recipe, so i&#39;m having to initialize the array  inside  of the for loop based on the input.  Is there any method like .equals for string objects except its &#34;not equals&#34; or != for strings?      I&#39;m trying to use them for a while loop where if the next scanned String is equal to &#34;EndOrder&#34; then it will exit the while loop.  For A2 Jedi, I&#39;m having difficulty with getting my menu items to populate into an array when asking the user for their selection of menu items. For the first test, I am using a while loop that evaluates if the user has entered &#34;EndOrder&#34; or not, and if not then check the first item in the menu item array and see if there&#39;s a match. However, Avocado_Roll (based on test 1) seems to be the only menu item that is being read and populated into the array and I&#39;m not sure how to work around this. I&#39;m also not using 2D arrays as if I&#39;m not sure if that makes the program easier.  For the Jedi part of assignment 2, I&#39;m having trouble associating a menuItem with its recipe items (name, amountOunces). I&#39;m trying to use parallel arrays, but each menu item can have multiple recipe items with name and amount. Not sure how to structure this in arrays and save for later use.   I think I know how to do this with couple of additional classes (RecipeItem, MenuItem), but I&#39;m trying to do this with simple arrays (parallel/multi-dim)      Any ideas?  I&#39;m trying to build an array of objects and use the scanner to input objects into the array. To build each object using the scanner I made a helper method, but I keep getting an error that reads:      No enclosing instance of type A2Novice is accessible. Must qualify the allocation with an enclosing instance of type A2Novice (e.g. x.new A() where x is an instance of A2Novice).          What does this mean?     I&#39;m initializing an array as this:   String[][] itemIngredients = new String[menuCount][];   Where the second bracket is blank because I need further input from scanner to determine the length of the array.   After, I fill in the array using two for loops:      for (int m = 0; m &lt; menuCount; m&#43;&#43;) { \titemName[m] = scan.next(); \tint ingredientCount = scan.nextInt(); \tfor (int n = 0; n &lt; ingredientCount; n&#43;&#43;) { \t\titemIngredients[m][n] = scan.next(); \t\tounces[m][n] = scan.nextDouble();\t\t \t} }   Although, I get a null pointer exception when I enter an itemIngredients string value into [m][n].   I&#39;m wondering if this issue is happening because I didn&#39;t declare the length of the second row.   Or is not declaring the length of the second dimension completely fine and there&#39;s another issue happening that I&#39;m missing??    When I initialize my arrays, I do it like this:      double[] avg = new double[4];      And I am under the impression that this makes an array with 5 slots (0 - 4) that are all automatically declared as empty for me. I want to fill in the slots as I go, but whenever I try, it tells me Null Pointer Exception. I don&#39;t understand why this is happening if I declared an array with 5 slots already, ready to be filled.      I&#39;ve solved this problem by making a for loop and manually setting each slot to 0 directly afterwards, but that seems unnecessary. Is there a better way to go about this?  In Adept test 1, my output of the Avocado_roll was 53 calories, instead of 52, and the similar question happened on the KMP_roll. I followed the format on github and don&#39;t understand why. This is my code:   sumOfC = sumOfC &#43; (( int ) (c * amountOfIngredients[k] &#43; 0.5));   Anybody knows why?  my local and remote repos arent synched up so i was wondering how to force push from eclipse to github?  So KMP talked about these things today in lecture, and I&#39;m gonna be honest, I have absolutely no idea what he&#39;s talking about. I know we&#39;ve gone over static before, but I still don&#39;t get it. And with abstraction, I get it&#39;s somehow related to objects? But that&#39;s basically it.  Gradescope only gave me 8/10 for A2, giving me two issues in A2 Novice.              Just looking at the input with my eyes alone, I can see that for Test 1, Seaweed has the most calories, not rice, and Rice clearly has the least.  Gradescope is expecting strange things for some reason.   For Test 3, gradescope seems to have similar issues.      Does anyone know what I should do?  I don&#39;t want to program in some exception case for that particular input just for Gradescope, but also don&#39;t want to get only 8/10.  when i try committing and pushing to github, it doesn&#39;t seem to have gone through. i also keep getting this message saying something is rejected?       For this assignment are points going to be taken off for coding style or for specific formatting requirements? when I try committing and pushing my changes to github in the git staging window it says there are no unstaged changes. I know this isn&#39;t the case because i haven&#39;t submitted my work for A1Jedi yet. why is this happening? So I run my code on Eclipse and it runs without errors. I send it through gradescope to see if the novice section is 3/3 to continue on to adept but when gradescope runs the code, it produces an error????  Dear instructor,       In the A1 example, the program shows that: &#34;Your Java version: 1.8.0_221&#34;, which is different from &#34;12.02&#34; in your videos. Would it be a problem?     Whenever I try to commit and push this error comes up:   Can&#39;t connect to any repository: https://github.com/Fall2019COMP401-001/a1-jfea40.git (https://github.com/Fall2019COMP401-001/a1-jfea40.git: git-receive-pack not permitted on &#39;https://github.com/Fall2019COMP401-001/a1-jfea40.git/&#39;)      I am signed in properly, but it does not come up on github either  So the input we give to A1Adept is:    6 Apple 0.25 Banana 0.75 Milk 3.15 Orange 1.25 Salami 2.50 Sponge 1.15 3  Carrie Brownstein 3 2 Banana 1 Orange 2 Milk Corin Tucker 2 3 Banana 2 Sponge Janet Weiss 1 5 Salami    So you&#39;d have to store the prices and names of each item in an array before going on to applying them to each customer, right?   How would you make it so that when you give    Carrie Brownstein 3 2 Banana 1 Orange 2 Milk    That it would automatically link the &#34;Banana&#34; price from before to the &#34;Banana&#34; that&#39;s being asked for Carrie? When I try putting in the example input code into A1 Jedi, I get an error message that says something is wrong with my line of code where I scan in the price of the item. My code for that line is: double priceOfItem = scan.nextDouble();  The error message looks like this in my console after I enter the example input code:  3 Carrie Brownstein 3 2 Banana 0.75 1 Orange 1.25 2 Milk 3.15 Corin Tucker 2 3 Banana 0.75 2 Sponge 1.15 Janet Weiss 1 5 Salami 2.50Exception in thread &#34;main&#34; java.util.InputMismatchException \tat java.base/java.util.Scanner.throwFor(Scanner.java:939) \tat java.base/java.util.Scanner.next(Scanner.java:1594) \tat java.base/java.util.Scanner.nextDouble(Scanner.java:2564) \tat a1.A1Adept.main(A1Adept.java:19)   I suppose it has to do something with the fact that I said priceOfItem is a double, but I used the same code in my A1 Adept project and it worked fine. Can anyone provide some clarity? (I also know that we don&#39;t use the prices of the items in the output for A1 Jedi but we still have to scan it in for input) Are we allowed to use object-oriented programming for A1Adept and A1Jedi, or do we have stick to just using built-in data types? Thank you! I left eclipse open for the past 2 days on my laptop and had saved all my work, but when I came back on this morning it said there was an error and that A1 Adept had been deleted. I had already submitted all my work for A1 adept on grade scope and it had all been correct but now it is missing. Is there ANY way to fix this???!!! Sos. I am failing jedi tests 2 and 3. For test 3, my counter is counting 4 bananas instead of 2 because I&#39;m obviously just counting them by item and not taking the name into account. Has anyone else encountered this and knows a quick way to implement so that before I do my &#34;&#43;&#43;&#34; It makes sure its not in the same customer name? I cant figure out this last step! Thanks!  Ok, I tried just about any type of formatting with these print lines. I have no idea what&#39;s incorrect. I&#39;ve tried looking at other posts and it seems to not apply to me.       Output: Biggest: Janet Weiss (12.50) Smallest: Corin Tucker (4.55) Averege: 8.70  Output did not match expectations. Expected output: Biggest: Janet Weiss (12.50) Smallest: Corin Tucker (4.55) Average: 8.70   Also here&#39;s my code if that helps!   \t\t\t// output \t \t\tSystem.out.println(&#34;Biggest: &#34; &#43; maxBuy.printline()); \t\t \t\tSystem.out.println(&#34;Smallest: &#34; &#43; minBuy.printline()); \t\t \t\tSystem.out.println(&#34;Averege: &#34; &#43; average);   And here&#39;s the methods if that also clears up anything!   \tprintout = (this.wholename&#43; &#34; (&#34; &#43; this.total &#43; &#34;)&#34;);     I submitted my code but the autograder shows me that Example Test isn&#39;t working? What code is this supposed to be? The expected output seems to be matching my output  I am struggling to figure out how to avoid the duplication problem when counting the number of customers who have bought a specific item (ex. Janet Weiss 2 Salami 2 Salami 1 Salami shows up as &#34;3 customers bought 5 salami&#34; in my output). Does anyone have any advice for this issue? :)     For the first assignment, besides just submitting and running the novice, adept, and jedi parts on github gradescope. Is there anything else we have to submit?  I can&#39;t use the run function, its giving me an error stating the ANT Build cannot be found   Good evening class. Quick question how is the price of a menu item compute?      I had the understanding that it was ounces * pricePerOunces for each ingredient, but in the sample input for the first case where we have:   Rice -&gt; 0.5 Ounces * 0.12 pricePerOunces   Avocado -&gt; 0.5 Ounces * 0.22 pricePerOunces   Seaweed -&gt; 0.1 Ounces * 2.95 pricePerOunces      The total gives me $0.52.      Any suggestions?  My console prints the following before I hit &#34;enter&#34; on A1, Adept      Biggest: Carrie Brownstein (9.05) Smallest: null null (0.00) Average: 3.02 Biggest: Carrie Brownstein (9.05) Smallest: null null (0.00) Average: 4.53      After hitting enter however, the correct values print... (see below)      Biggest: Janet Weiss (12.50) Smallest: Corin Tucker (4.55) Average: 8.70      I also had a similar issue on Novice where the third name only appeared after I hit &#34;enter&#34;, but despite this my Novice still passed the autograder.      How do I proceed? Is it my code or a console setting?      edit: after separating the System.out onto different lines it passes Adept 2 but only adept 2, not the others despite the correct output coming after i hit enter     I ran the A1example in my Eclipse, and then found out that my java version is 1.8.0_191. How can I update it? Or, am i able to finish the hw without updating?  Whenever I try to save my code for adept, this error comes up saying that the &#34;current target virtual machine...is unable to replace the running code with the code in the workspace.&#34; This error only shows for my adept code and not for novice or jedi.   Does anyone know how I can fix this?  Does anyone know the entry code we need for My Digital Hand? I&#39;m trying to make an account for office hours, but it says there&#39;s an entry code to join the class.  I&#39;m not sure if anyone else is having this problem, but this example (I got the rest correct) shows up wrong, even though my output is the same as the expected output, even the spaces, Gradescope says it&#39;s incorrect.    Is there any difference???????????????????       Adept Test 2 &amp; 3  both work but  Test 1  tells me that my output did not match expectations......        So for my A1 Adept code, everything works however I get none of the points because there is a space between the name and the parenthesis, however when I test it in my console on Eclipse, there is no space. Not sure what to do about this.  title  does anyone know how to fix &#34;Editor does not contain main type&#34; error  Despite what the announcement says, there appears to be no invitation link.      When I run my example code, following KMP along in the youtube video, every time I run the example code my output is &#34;my average height is 68.31 inches&#34; instead of &#34;Your Java version: 12.0.2&#34;.  I didn&#39;t change anything in the example code so I have no idea where this is coming from.  This is what my screen looks like.  i also don&#39;t know why I have the &#34;Branches, tags, and references&#34;, etc sidebars. Thanks!      I follow the instructions to import the homework a1, but it shows error. Can anyone figure it out?         This may be a dumb question, but I couldn&#39;t find it on the syllabus. Do we have unlimited submissions to gradescope before the due date? Is there any punishment to submitting too many times? In other words, are points deducted from our grades with each submission? Thanks for the help! For every example it says that it could not find or load main class a1.A1Example. What shall I do then?    Can we create inner classes for Customers and Products, and use ArrayLists in Assignment 1? I know that these topics are not covered in this class yet. Or is it better just to stick to Arrays for now?    According to the assignment, we need to make our repositories private. I tried to look up how to do it on the internet and according to the official GitHub tutorial, it should be done through &#34;Settings&#34;, which is located under the repository name. Here is the screenshot from GitHub tutorial:       I don&#39;t have &#34;Settings&#34; under my repository name. In &#34;Method For Setting up Repo as Eclipse Project&#34;, there is &#34;Settings&#34; option available.        Is anybody else having the same problem? Did I do something wrong? Or should I just continue with the assignment?  When do office hours start??  I used the 2 decimal place rounding expression on the line above my print statement, but my output is       C. Brownstein: 9.05 C. Tucker: 4.55 J. Weiss: 12.5   instead of      C. Brownstein: 9.05 C. Tucker: 4.55 J. Weiss: 12.50      Edit: I fixed the problem by creating a string variable and assigning it the rounding expression using the double variable  Does the commit message have to be something actually useful, or is it just for us to document to ourselves so we can keep track of edits? AKA, is anyone else going to be reading them? I kept making a lot of small edits to my code, desperately trying to find whatever small bug was causing it to not run, and it got to the point where I was flustered and half of my messages were just along the lines of &#34;okay, maybe this time it will work please&#34; or &#34;PLEASE WORK&#34; or &#34;ahhhhhhh&#34;. I&#39;ll properly document my code with commit messages if needed, but is it used by anyone other than me?  When I click run, it shows me &#34;Selection does not contain Main type&#34;     I am in Information Science and I was enrolled in 401 least weekend. When I tried to reset password on Gradescope, the email said:        A request to reset your password on Gradescope has been made, but we could not find a user associated with email address         How could I get access to Gradescope?         I&#39;m more familiar with IntelliJ IDEA, so I was wondering if I could use IntelliJ IDEA to finish my homework.  Thanks!        Why did I miss Adept Test 1, while other Adept Tests are correct?  Hi everyone. I noticed that KMP said in the video that I can change the associate account with Github. I did that and set my unc email as my primary account. I did that before I registered for gradescope but after I receive the invitation. I have received the first point on my gradescope with my current account. Will that be fine if I continue to use this account?  how do you make the code round to 2 decimal places?   Hello, I am the graduate student major in information science but I didn&#39;t register in this course successfully. However, I hope to audit this course and  complete the required assignments. Could someone share the specific requirements of first assignment?  Thank you so much!  I submitted my code to Gradescope and I get 0 out of 1 for all the tests for novice even though I get the right output in eclipse. On Gradescope it shows that I have no output but I do get output when I use my code on eclipse.      Does anyone know what I should do?  How long is it taking you guys to complete a section of the assignment (novice, jedi, etc)?      It took me around 3 and a half hours just to finish novice, and on top of that, an extra ~40 mins just to figure out how to get it to two decimal places.      I&#39;m just asking because I want to know if I desperately need to try harder, or if someone else is sharing my struggle to adjust.      Thanks!  Hi, what is the class code for our course&#39;s gradescope? Gradescope will not let me sign up without the class code even when using my UNC email address. Thank you.  I used a wrong account in the autograder and it seems that I cannot change the linked account there. Is there any way to fix that? Thanks!    I used my personal GitHub account for GitHub classroom and associated my name with it. How can I change the association to be with my new Github account that uses my UNC email?  When I try to run the programs from Github repository, a pop-up keeps occurring that says &#34;Editor does not contain a main type, and the program then won&#39;t run.
