     Also, here is a picture of the error in the Local Check window:       local_checks.jpg         Average: 151/207      Common mistake:   Some of you called run instead of start on the Thread object. All this does is call is the run method without creating a new thread. Your animation should have shown at least two avatars animating at the same time on the screen.      Andrew  Class,      Yesterday (Saturday) I made some more corrections to A12 to make naming of tags and parse methods consistent with what we had in A11. Again, these were done with track changes on. Three tags that had CommandObject now have Command as a suffix. Also a few parse methods now end with Command as a suffix. These all apply to extra credit and will be caught by localchecls.      Also I changed localchecks to identify extra credit\\xa0correctly.      I also corrected the link to the A12 checkstyle\\xa0file which pointed to A11.      Finally in the demo part,, I reversed two steps for those who did lockstep.      Prasun        My programs works basically fine and the tests are all positive except for one:      commandObjects.DefineCallCommandObejctTestCase      The error message says the X of one of the lines is 317, instead of 302.      I just want to know what kind of code is used on this one, for example, what kind of command string does it give, so that I can create my own test and see the details more thoroughly.  Hey Everyone,      Tutoring will be Today (Monday) and Tuesday from 6 - 7:15 (will stay later if need be) in SN047. This will be the last chance before your final to ask questions. I would recommend focusing on conceptual stuff and less on specific assignments at this point, however I would be happy to help with assignments if that is what most people are interested in.\\xa0      best,   Sam     In the assignment pdf, it says to tag the define, call and thread command classes &#34;DefineCommandObject&#34;, &#34;CallCommandObject&#34; and &#34;ThreadCommandObject,&#34; but when ran with local checks, the local check suite reported errors in CommandInterperterSuite and CommandObjectSuiteA12 &#34;no class tagged definecommand,... no class tagged callcommand, ... no class tagged threadcommand.&#34; Removing the word &#34;Object&#34; from the tagged classes resolved these problems, so I was just wondering which one is the correct tag.  I&#39;m getting an error from the auto grader that &#34;Message:Leaf object: mp.AnImage&#64;3c1f0df2 replaced with:mp.ABridgeScene&#64;4eb61ac3&#34;, however my code works as it is supposed to and the animations work, but when I run it through the autograder it&#39;s telling me that my image is being replace by my ABridgeScene class. I went to the TA and he said my code looks fine but wasn&#39;t able to figure out why the error is occuring.  This is the error I&#39;m getting when i run the auto grader. As you can see my AnImage instance moves from (200,20) to (212,33) as it is supposed to before the error occurs.         ObjectEditor(Version 22, built on Wed Sep 07 12:53:46 EDT 2016).

get it working, but it more or less seems to work on my very limited tests (I need to make a fix to record correct grades in Sakai).      To test drive it, go to:\\xa0 https://grader.cs.unc.edu/ \\xa0   authenticate,   select upload from menu bar   fill\\xa0menu entries (Choose Assignment for Type)   chose zip file you would submit to sakai\\xa0(if this works we have a plugin also)   press upload button   pray   see results if you get them.      Currently checkstyel checks will be done only for A10.      I still think it will take a miracle to get it to really work, but life is boring if you do not believe in miracles ..      Prasun        Students,      I&#39;m moving my (last!) office hours today to 5-7pm.      -Assignment 11 will be graded soon. You should have a good idea of your grade from the local checks.   -If there&#39;s anything urgent you should see me in office hours   -If you have issues with local checks/grading you should put it here or send it to the help account, not directly to me.\\xa0Even if I help you, it helps the professor to be aware of the issue. I can tell you I&#39;ve seen A11 and A12 local checks pass on students&#39; assignments.      Andrew     For questions 27-30 what is meant by &#34;an argument of 2&#34;?      Also what is meant by &#34;dynamic dispatching&#34;?  Class,      I just spent an enjoyable afternoon reading your class discussion submissions and have uploaded the grades.      You got some points for attendance which I gauged based on whether I knew your name, how frequently I saw you in class, and whether you were in class the day I took attendance. So if you did sign the sheet and received a 0, send us mail.      Prasun  Class,      The submissions for A1-A11are closed\\xa0at this point.      I saw several of you working on A11 yesterday.      I would suggest taking your chances with the grader server and trying to get your assigments graded through it if you did not get a chance to submit them before the close date. if you are successful (there is no time to fix iteh server), take a screen shot of your grade and more important send us mail about which ones were graded.      If we have time to process your mails, we will take this into account in the fudge factor.      I would recommend doing this only if you have completed assignments, not if you plan to complete them at the expense of other courses as I do not trust the server.

space on campus to try and go over the practice exam? If so shoot me an email at  jjahuja&#64;live.unc.edu \\xa0and Ill send out more information.  Class,      1. Please bring scratch paper or an erasable\\xa0dark pencil - as in the midterm you will have plenty of time.   2. The instructions have changed, so read them carefully.   3. The biggest change is that the question and answer parts are separate. You can keep the question part. The answer part is 6 pages.   4. You get 5 points\\xa0for writing your name and initials in capitals.   5. Please keep monitoring this post as I might add to this list.      Prasun  I forgot to submit assignment 12 last night, is there any way I could still turn it in?  Class,         I fixed a problem with the way I had named A12 (It had a &#34;/&#34; in the name which was causing problems) and so the grading server is behaving better.      Three different students have submitted closed assignments using it today.      I just wanted to let you all know in case you tried and saw a message &#34;so many people in the queue before you&#34;.      If you are able to successfully use it for a submitted assignment, please send us mail (the help alias) with the header: &#34;CLOSED ASSIGNMENTS&#34; with a screen shot of the results, the assignment numbers, and the times you submitted the assignments. If we get time we will look at the log and your message, especially if you are on the borderline.      The three of you who sent mail today, please forward the mail with the correct subject line to the help alias.      Again,good luck with preparing for 401 and other exams!      Prasun  #2 C &amp; D:   Do both threads start at the same time? causing them to run the run method and get into the wait()?    Median 297/362      Good luck on your exams!   comp401-002-f16&#64;cs.unc.edu \\xa0is the list serve email address, thus we all get emails sent to that address.       help401-002-f16&#64;cs.unc.edu \\xa0is the email address to which we are supposed to direct questions regarding grades, and where screen shots should be sent from the online grader.\\xa0  Fewer people turned this one in and there were a lot of extra credit points.. Of those who did: average 155/85.     I was just wondering when should we expect to get our grades back for the late assignments that we turned in? \\xa0I haven&#39;t gotten any assignments backs since assignment 6 because I turned them in a little late but it has been a while since I turned them in.      Thanks!  Everyone accidentally got 15% off their A12 so we adjusted the total points to be 72  Class,      1 Grade the exams.   2. Grade the late assignments - remember there is no disputing with them. - whatever the autograder\\xa0gives is what we are required to give.   3. Process all individual emails about valid grading issues,   4. Process individual emails about issues with mistakes you made or post-close date submissions, which will be done mainly for borderline students.   5. Give final grade.      We are shooting for finishing 1-4 by noon tomorrow.      Prasun       Not sure why the local checks test for bridge scene controller does not work. It works when I manually interact with it.\\xa0      This is the error given by that test suite in particular (after it automatically runs the observable painter test):      ObjectEditor(Version 22, built on Sat Nov 19 11:40:44 GMT-05:00 2016).

BridgeSceneControllerSuite: 0.0  Hello Everyone,      Hope you guys had a good break. I&#39;ll be holding tutoring on Monday and Tuesday this week from 6-7:15 in SN047. This seems to accommodate some peoples schedules better. Again you can always email me with questions.\\xa0      Sam     Package: lectures.exceptions   Quiz: Exceptions    &#34;Subscript checking is inefficient if programmers code carefully enough to never get an error.&#34;      By error, they mean subscript error.  So do we have to resumbit all of our participations in class into Take 2? I&#39;m assuming that for the original discussion the files were overwritten everytime a new thing was submitted.   I have a few of them in my records, but I don&#39;t have some of the early ones.  The final due date for assignment 4-9 is November, 30 2016 11:55 pm. I thought that the final resubmission\\xa0date for all assignments except Assignment 12 is Dec. 4th/5th? Is there any way that can be changed, I&#39;d like to resubmit some assignments for extra credit.\\xa0    Hello, for the method hasNext(), I can&#39;t seem to be able to implement a correct way of identifying if the next token in an array exists or if peek() will throw an out of bounds exception. Are we supposed to use peek() in the method of hasNext()?  In the ObjectHistoryUser class in the praxis, one of the question is swapping the two addElement&#39;s and another question is swapping the two prinln&#39;s. However, originally one of each is commented out, we are supposed to first uncomment then swap the order right?    Will our recitation grades be based solely on the quizzes? There were prior assignments that don&#39;t seem to be accounted for.        Class,      Generics and adapters now show feedback.      Based on a request from a student, I have updated the due dates of all assignments after #2 to Dec 5th.      Prasun  Are on the web. Also for those who started during the break, I made some tracked changes to the assignment\\xa0during the break. So do make sure you look at the latest version  Should the key of the table still be a String or should it be a generic parameter as well?  I&#39;m getting weird errors in my Recitation 12 code. For example it&#39;s asking me if I want to create a class called Object on one of the object arrays (which is hilariously absurd). I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s the project or my eclipse? Every other one of my projects are working fine.\\xa0  In the Assignment 12 document, it tells us to basically copy the clearance manager from the JavaTeaching package. \\xa0This clearance manager does not have a proceedAll() method. \\xa0In implementing this method are there any particular ways we should broadcast that the method is called? \\xa0Should we just have it broadcast basically the same as the other methods? \\xa0i.e.:      System.out.println( Thread.currentThread() &#43; &#34;: before proceedAll&#34;); [code]  System.out.println( Thread.currentThread() &#43; &#34;: after proceedAll&#34;);   or something like this?      Just realized that there is ABroadcastingClearanceManager which extends the clearance manager I was looking at and includes a proceedAll() method, but there is still no broadcast in this method - does this mean we don&#39;t need one?  Hi. Are the two tables, i.e. the one for string-command correspondences and the one for name-avatar correspondences, the same instance of &#34;Table&#34;, or two different instances?      Based on the homework pdf, which says:   &#34;Use generics to define your table class and elaborate this class with different type parameters to (a) map avatar names to avatars and (b) implement the extended grammar with define and call commands (if you do the extended grammar, see section on extended grammar below). &#34;,   I assume they are two instances of the\\xa0Table class.      So now that there are two instances, does the SingletonsCreator creates the avatar table or the command table?      Based on former assignments, I guess SingletonsCreator creates the avatar table.       So just to make sure, we\\xa0don&#39;t have to make another factory method to create the command table, correct?  The homework pdf specifies the parameter(s) of the constructors of the command classes.      I&#39;m wondering, are we allowed to have multiple constructors with one of them in accordance with the spec?  I know we declare the methods in the abstract classes, but do we define the methods in there as well (not abstract methods)?\\xa0  Hey Everyone,      I&#39;m on vacation this week so I will not be tutoring Today or Wednesday. Sorry for the late notice, forgot to post this morning. I will have hours next week when everyone returns and possibly extra hours closer to the final in order to accommodate final review. Have a good break everyone!      Sam     I&#39;m getting two kinds of errors in my LocalChecks. The first one is saying that when it a runs a command, my X-value in the Line class is off. The other is saying that my when my asynchronousArthur() and asynchronousLancelot() is called at the end of the test, they are in sync... I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s an error in part or not because I felt I did this part correctly. Any guidance would surely help.

I&#39;m getting a No Such Method error with respect to the constructor (I think) on the Repeat Command Object Test Case. All of my other test cases are passing with the exception of this one and I&#39;m not sure why... I have the class tagged\\xa0&#64;Tags({&#34;RepeatCommand&#34;}) which I believe is the correct tag, so I&#39;m not quite sure why this is failing. I&#39;ve attached a picture of the error for reference.\\xa0      Also, my constructor takes two parameters, an int numTimes and a Runnable command, in that order, which I believe is how it&#39;s specified in the assignment.\\xa0       error.PNG   Package:\\xa0lectures.generics_adapters   Quiz:Generics and Adapters  Any idea what this\\xa0error is from? The first runTest for Arthur from\\xa0the commandinterpretermoveTest works correctly,\\xa0but the other ones do not and this is the error when I try to run\\xa0Galahad individually.           What is the difference between B and C? Is C stating that X animation will not start while Y animation is concurrent?      &#34;The three animators             A.\\xa0run serially, that is, while one animator is executing, other animators wait.      \\xa0B.\\xa0animate in the Y direction serially, that while one animator is animating in the Y direction, the other animators do not animate in the Y direction.      C.\\xa0animate in the X and Y direction serially, that is while one animator is animating in the X (Y) direction, the other animators do not animate in the X (Y) direction.        D.\\xa0run without any coordination.&#34;            While I am passing the SyncAnimationSuite part of the LocalChecks, I get an exception whenever it does the SyncArthurLancelotTestCase. I gave each avatar its own animator object. I narrowed it down to my ThreadSupport.sleep(time) method. I tried commenting it out, resulting in failure. I keep the time within 10000 ms (10 seconds) and it still causes a InterruptedException. Is there something I am missing here?      \\xa0   ### gradingTools.comp401f16.assignment11.sync.testcases.SyncArthurLancelotTestCase: 1.0   Calling on object class grail.misc.ASingletonsCreator

Median (of those students) 105/110      For those of you turning in assignments very late (after the other students get their grade for the assignment):      -Your assignments will be automatically graded only (you won&#39;t get points for the manual checks)   -I strongly suggest you use the local checks   -Make sure you don&#39;t have illegal imports, magic numbers, and classes as types instead of interfaces    To what extent do we have to actually implement our abstract classes that we create? The assignment prompt gives no directions on this, it just states to create an abstract class for the token and shape hierarchy.  I&#39;m getting a weird &#34;NoSuchMethodException&#34; when running the Say Command Object Test Case, \\xa0it reads as follows:      Test Failed:java.lang.NoSuchMethodException mp.commands.SayCommand.&lt;init&gt;(mp.tokens.Token, java.lang.String)      Maybe I&#39;m misinterpreting this but I thought the constructor was not supposed to take Tokens as arguments but it looks like the test case is trying to initialize it with one. Either way, I&#39;m not quite sure what the error means.      For reference, I downloaded the checks tonight, so they are up to date, and my Move Command Object Test Case passes with flying colors. I&#39;ve also attached a screenshot.       error.PNG     &#34;Example of use of this feature: {move guard &#43;10 -100 rotateRightArm guard -9} The second command above assumes you have done the extra credit mentioned below.&#34;      Does this mean we have to create respective rotate commands for Extra Credit on this assignment? It is not mentioned aside from this example so it is confusing whether or not its part of the actual assignment.  Will the local checks be available before the early submission deadline tonight?    Would we have to deal with such a case like this:      { command command command { command .... } }\\xa0  Hi, in some previous assignment, I implemented some error resilient mechanism of the command interpreter with a error property of type List&lt;String&gt;, and OE sends warning of sending notification of composite property. Is it fine to ignore such warning?    A11&#39;s checkstyle file gives the same false negatives or error statements that contradict the assignment parameters.(For instance importing component from prior assignments is considered illegal.)  Class, the package is:\\xa0      lectures.animation.threads.synchronized_methods      The quiz is:\\xa0Animations: Synchronized Methods      We hope to add another praxis and quiz \\xa0on the related idea of wait/notfy before the class is over  In InterferingConcurrentShuttleAnimation, the animation may not run because in the last praxis (ctrl &#43; click on concurrentDemoShuttleAnimation in main), the &#34;correct&#34; constructor for the Thread (the one with the animator) was commented out. Uncomment that and the InterferingConcurrentShuttleAnimation should run.  Another praxis, also due after Thanksgiving is added to JavaTeaching. It is in package:      lectures.animation.threads.wait_notify.lock;      The quiz on Sakai is called &#34;Wait, Notify, and Locks&#34;  For this particular question in the Synchronized Thread Praxis there can be more than one answer:      (T/F) After removing the inter-thread delay, the loop in animateXFromOrigin() is executed at least once by the second thread.  Minor corrections for A11:      1. The command examples use &#34;passed&#34; and &#34;failed&#34; as commands. These should have been &#34;pass&#34; and &#34;fail&#34;   2. The signed number extra credit example uses a rotateRightArm command. This is implemented in the next assignment, not this one. Also, there should have been spaces between the tokens. The example should have been:   { move guard &#43; 10 - 100 move arthur - 20 10 }        When do\\xa0all late assignments for the semester need to be submitted by?  I&#39;m not sure I know where the readonly property CommandObject is at? I&#39;m guessing we have to declare it in the Parser class...  Will the parsing methods have parameters?  Class,      I am still working on it, but have meetings in the afternoon in which I hope to complete the command objects. Here is what I have, it uses some nasty commands so do not be surprised if some of them fail, there is enough credit for the simple ones.      As usual, this is symbiotic, I help you test your code and you help me test the tests.      The tests assume:      A failed or passed knight can approach again.      The number of scanned tokens is less than 100 (if I gave you a lower limit (50?) earlier, please bump it, or I will change or\\xa0remove one of the tests.)      Prasun  Could not load class:.\\\\src\\\\grail\\\\CommandList.java ClassNotFoundException CommandList        Got this error in the console while running the RunTest for Assignment 11.\\xa0 How do I go about correcting this?\\xa0 I have a class called CommandList, so I&#39;m not sure why it can&#39;t load.     That leaves synchronized methods, which will be a few hours at \\xa0least    I originally had an error with the local checks related to the repeat commands. This was due to the fact that I had implemented a ThreadSupport sleep within the run of a Repeat Command to emphasize that the animation was being repeated. Upon removing this, the checks worked fine. Should I resubmit my assignment or will it be accounted for?  Hi,      It turned out I had uploaded a version of code in which I had been experimenting with Threads (for writing the last quiz question). It shouldn&#39;t have affected anything besides giving a lot of odd output, but the updated code is now online.      Sorry for the inconvenience,   Semion  Class,      Just uploaded them.      That leaves Parser factory method and parser properties, which I will try and integrate in the parser \\xa0testcases. If I do not get to them by tonight, please check them carefully.      PS; I added the parser method test      Prasun  How could I test this part? In the last assignment I called all 4 methods and it caused all four characters to be animating at the same time. If I did this correctly, then it should animate each character one by one, meaning once one character is done, it&#39;ll jump to next and then so on??  Just added tests to see that parser creates command objects .. t  I ran into this problem with A11&#39;s SyncAnimationSuite, if the animator&#39;s total runtime is greater than 2000ms, then runtime checks would just kill it and does not wait for the animation to finish, resulting in failed test for potentially correct code. If you think this is the case for your code consider changing the runtime length of your animation. I am not sure if this is a bug or intended feature.  I REALLY hope next time the test suite can be made better or the spec can be written in a more precise way.   I have more than one constructor for RepearCommand, one of which takes no argument, and this results in an error which takes me unnecessary 20 mins to fix.  Can I resubmit an old assignment after adding on the extra credit parts to recieve extra credit now?  A word of caution to those of us relying on local checks. The following tests DO NOT have a space after the last token, so if your scanner is not coded to handle this (mine is not), these tests WILL fail even if your parsing is done correctly:   PraserCreatesRepeatCommandObjectTestCase   ManyLevelListMovesTestCase   ManyLevelLevelRepeatManyLevelList      Until the checks are fixed, you will have to manually debug these yourself, using\\xa0the argument the tests use except with the needed space after the last token.  Did anyone run into issues with the RepeatCommandObjectTestCase? I get the following error and I have no idea if it&#39;s the local checks that&#39;s calling something wrong, if I&#39;m missing a class, if something might be tagged wrong, or something else entirely....      ### gradingTools.comp401f16.assignment11.commandObjects.testcases.RepeatCommandObjectTestCase: 1.0   Test Failed:java.lang.NoSuchMethodError util.introspect.JavaIntrospectUtility.getConstructorISA(Ljava/lang/Class; Ljava/lang/Class;)Ljava/lang/reflect/Constructor;%0.0   ### gradingTools.comp401f16.assignment11.commandObjects.testcases.RepeatCommandObjectTestCase: 0.0  I was curious. \\xa0When repaint is called on a view, it should call the paint method of that same view. \\xa0   So for example, when repaint is called on the avatar View, every time a propertychange event happens, then repaint should be called on the Avatar causing it to paint that new event in the window. \\xa0Is that how it should work?  After seeing my grade returned for Assignment 7, I did some investigating and realized I accidentally turned in a rough draft that contained a null pointer exception preventing the main method from running. \\xa0I understand that this was an embarrassingly careless mistake on my part but is there any way to re-submit this and earn any credit back (at-least in the auto-graded parts)? This was a fairly heavily weighted assignment and it&#39;s taking a huge toll on my grade.    Assignment 7 gives the same issue on feedback that Assignment 6 did, no actual point breakdowns, just blank space with a random loss shown. See below: 20161106_2.png   Hey Everyone,      Tutoring will be Monday and Wednesday as usual this week. Monday will be from 6-6:45, Wednesday will be from 6-7:15.

Java Package:\\xa0lectures.inheritance.abstract_classes   Sakai Quiz: abstract classes  Students,      Due to a small hiccup, many of you did not get the breakdown of your grade for A7 in your feedback file. I have uploaded the full feedback files on Sakai in a separate read-only assignment called &#34;Assignment 7 Feedback&#34;. Use the breakdown from that feedback file,  except the last two   checks  you will have 0 points but in your actual grade, they were not 0 because those were manual checks.      The problem has been fixed and won&#39;t happen in future assignment feedback files.      Andrew       A lot of the checks on A10 are giving false negatives or are triggering warnings for items that are permitted as per the assignment directions.

See console output%0.9736842105263158&#34;      The area of interest is how local checks requires that preFailed after the Guard say be false. \\xa0According to the assignment 6 instructions where we first implemented failed, it&#39;s supposed to be able to fail either the Guard or the Knight standing based on who&#39;s turn it is to speak. Therefore, wouldn&#39;t the precondition only be that the knight area is occupied prior to executing fail? Furthermore, if this is the case, executing a say method wouldn&#39;t change the occupancy of the knightarea. Additionally, the knight area would have to be occupied in order for say to be executed to begin with. Wouldn&#39;t this mean that the idea that preFailed must be false after a Guard say is wrong?  Say I have a precondition for a method that is something like (a &amp;&amp; !b). \\xa0If another method says something like b = true, then clearly this precondition is now false, but if another method says b = false, then should we check a and only fire an event if a is true?      Actually, I think a is a precondition to the only method that sets b = false, so I think I don&#39;t need this. \\xa0You can disregard this question  Class,      They are on the web.      They assume that the tags and names and methods with precondition are the same. So if you have a method tagged approach, the checks assume that it is named approach and more important, its precondition is named preApproach. In case the name is different, it should be a small matter to rename the methods. Look at the precondtion test output carefully, it has 36 checks, worth 2 points each.      Again, let me know of false positives and negatives.      The tests are not comprehensive, there will be manual grading of console view and extra credit.      Prasun  In some of my say, approach, etc. methods I have if-else statements. How would one assert those? I know how to assert a simple if statement but it gets more messy when you have more conditions.      Example:   say method:   Occupied has to be true &amp;&amp; knightTurn has to be false so that the guard can speak   Occupied has to be true &amp;&amp; knightTurn has to be true so that the knight can speak      Do I have to test every condition or for this example or just test (assert) the Occupied value and then carry on with the rest of my code?          For the animation praxis is there anyway to jump straight to the breakpoint and observe what the questions want us to? It&#39;s unfeasible to keep hitting f8 to get to the break point with so many things coming before.  Today&#39;s lecture is really interesting, especially on the subject of parsing.   It never came to me that we can look at concepts like &#34;language&#34;, &#34;sentence&#34;, &#34;phrase&#34;, and etc, from such an abstract and concise perspective.   I&#39;m eager to know more on this topic, such as how to &#34;implement&#34;, or actualize, the grammar rules, how to implement a more general parser suitable for possibly any legal grammar set, how to handle possible ambiguity, how to possibly recover from errors, and more complicated stuff like, natural language.   Do you have any recommendations on maybe some reading materials or some course I can take?  1. for firing the precondition change event new PropertyChangeEvent(...), does that go in the precondition method or in the actual speak, pass, approach, and fail methods?      2. In his example, couldn&#39;t you just call\\xa0new PropertyChangeEvent(this, &#34;this&#34;, &#39;&#39;approach&#34;, preApproach()) instead of\\xa0new PropertyChangeEvent(this, &#34;this&#34;, &#39;&#39;approach&#34;, false) since the new condition value is always returned?  Can the\\xa0Animation: Threads and Commands praxis be extended till tomorrow or Sunday night? It&#39;s a long one so it&#39;s taking me sometime to finish it. Thanks!  Is there anyway you could extend the praxis until tomorrow night? I&#39;m not sure if I can get it done today and I really do not want to rush it.      [Never mind I&#39;m it&#39;s going quicker than I thought.]  Hi Professor,\\xa0      I had a hard time debugging one test that I didn&#39;t pass in the LocalChecks. The test is &#34;MoveCommandObjectTestCase&#34; shown red in the following picture. It shows that there&#39;s a null pointer, but I didn&#39;t find any null pointer in my code. I actually did the move command similarly to the say command. The say command worked, but the move didn&#39;t. I have spent more than 2 hours on this. Is there any chance that you can help me check my code?      Thanks!          Update: Andrew figured it out for me. I forgot to tag the move command.  Page 5 of assignemnt 10 under &#34;Animating/Demoing Main Class&#34;, number 3 says to display our code with the extended console view.      Does this mean that the boolean pre methods should be displayed in object editor? \\xa0Or how do you mean to &#34;display&#34; it?  In question 7 of the quiz, answer B says that order is controlled by lines 33 to 35 in class AScene. \\xa0But, lines 33 to 35 is a getter for the ship image.      Should this say lines 44 to 46 instead?  Hey Everyone,   In light of Halloween and the mess that Franklin will become, there will be no tutoring today. Tutoring will be held on Wednesday in SN047 from 6-7:15.\\xa0   best,   Sam    Given that the key controller portion of this part of the assignment responds to a prior mouseclick, should we write a mouse controller and then have an instance of it in our bridgescene controller?(which is really just a key controller in that case). Or should it be the other way around?(that is, an instance of the key controller in the mouse controller.  Package:\\xa0lectures.animation.threads_commands      Quiz:\\xa0Animation: Threads and Commands  For the questions asking about whether a thread is a &#34;current thread&#34; or a &#34;stopped thread&#34;, current threads are any threads that you can see in the debug window and stopped threads are specifically the threads that are stopped/suspended from your breakpoints and you are able to expand them and see their stacks. All stopped threads are current threads, but not all current threads will be stopped.

Important notice:      This week&#39;s 3:35pm recitation will be held in Hanes 130 this Friday, not in the usual room in Sitterson, due to an event that afternoon.      This does not affect the 1:25pm recitation- that one is in the same place.      I look forward to seeing everyone in class on Thursday as well- I will be doing a quick lecture on assertions, reviewing/answering any questions about material covered thus far, and the rest of the time will be spent finishing the praxis and/or working on the assignments.

I&#39;ve been stuck on this for too long, and cannot understand how to put this table together.

I&#39;ve attached a screenshot of the console output for reference.      Thanks for the help!  Class,      A9 local checks have been challenging, especially as I have tried to do them in a hurry.      I have posted them. Make sure your factory methods are correct.      For those of you who did not do the PaintListeners property, do not worry if you get a 0 in the existing paint listener test. We will check them manually.      No one will get full credit for the new paint listener test, because of some threading issues. You should get 30%.      To see if you are correct, look at the console output, If you see a message in capital saying paint event received,you are fine.      I am hoping I can have something that tests your controller in a few hours after some meetings      Prasun  For the static methods you want us to implement, what use will they serve? I have a couple of &#34;register&#34; methods that take a composite shape as a parameter and breaks it down into its respective atomic properties and adds the listener. I feel they are doing the same? For example my register method takes an avatar type and one of the lines inside it will be myAvatar.getArms().getLeftLine().addPropertyChangeListener(this); in the AnInheritingBridgeScenePainter class?     The Assignment PDF does NOT specify that we should ONLY include ONE method in PaintListener, paint.

scene? Given that there are 5 avatars each with their own text as well as a bridge, there are a lot of pieces to access.      Or to clarify this question, are we just observing the texts and the bridge?    How can we get object editor to pause between each action?(To show more of an animation without hitting refresh) I just get the end result of what the demo does. What should a boolean readonly property in A6 look like? An if/else statement in the property that returns True or False?  Also, how should the message text be changed for the Avatars in the RunTests? For example the RunTest wants the Avatar guard to say &#34;Quest?&#34; What is the correct way to go about doing this? Hi students,      I need to move my office hours on Wednesday 10/26 to Friday after each recitation (2:15pm and 4:25 pm).      (Your A6 will actually be graded on Thursday)      The recitation on Friday will go over creating custom views and MVC pattern. In the mean time feel free to e-mail me any questions or concerns.      Andrew    Will there be local checks for hw8 before the early submission time?    The HW8 Checkstyle gives the same false errors from previous assignments.

Old Value == New Value in some property notification. %0.85### gradingTools.comp401f16.assignment8.testcases.ConsoleSceneViewOutputTestCase: 0.85   \\xa0   Above is copied from the last part of the console log.      Hi I&#39;m debugging the assignment, and it says:   property: mp.ComponentClasses.GraphObjects.Atomic.AMovingString&#64;c25fedcnew value 510 == old value 510   but in the log, the two notifications of AMovingString both change the value of the property.      Why is that?    On question 12, the question asks which of the following contains the state.    in BMIMVCComposer, when questions talk about a &#34;connection&#34; between the model and another structure, a reference is a connection.  Just in case you guys have this issue, local checks shows my ConsoleSceneViewOutputTestCase[50.0 pts] is\\xa0wrong though the old/new values are correctly changed. Professor Dewan suggests not to print irrelevant words in your AConsoleView class (in my case is &#34;Property Change Event:&#34;) but just println the event itself. My problem is solved in this way. The previous error message is attached below.            ObjectEditor(Version 22, built on Wed Oct 26 15:41:27 EDT 2016). Copyright Prasun Dewan, 2012, All rights reserved. US Patent Appl.

I&#39;m getting an error in local check that says that I do not have 7 property notifications and I&#39;m pretty sure I do.\\xa0 I was wondering if there is maybe something I am not seeing.

I didn&#39;t see the time of the deadline and thought it was open till 11:59 tonight.  Which sections of material does the exam cover? Is it till Inheritance or until the most recent Collection kinds?   EDIT: Will arrays/arraylists/linkedlists be on the exam?  So I&#39;m still having difficulty trying to understand the difference between instance variables and properties. I know that properties don&#39;t necessarily have to have getters and setters, but if that&#39;s so, what defines a property?  Class,      The exam will involve coding and there will be a fixed amount of space for each question. We will be scanning the exam, so it is important you write in the allocated space.      I recommend you bring a dark \\xa0pencil \\xa0and eraser so you do not create multiple copies of your solution. The dark pencil is important from the scanning point of view.      Also bring some scratch paper - normally my exams are not long and you should have enough time to rewrite solutions if you need to.      And remember a good night sleep is normally good for coding success ...      The exam will have multiple related questions that build on each other - you will be able to \\xa0get credit for a question even if you\\xa0could not answer the preceding questions.\\xa0      Good luck ..      Prasun  1. Lets say we have an atomic type, how will the physical or logical structure look like?\\xa0   2. So will the structure have just a single node, with no edges connecting to it?         My attempt to answer it:   1. Since it is atomic, it isn&#39;t decomposable. Logical or physical structure wouldn&#39;t matter here since it doesn&#39;t have any edges connecting to it.   2. The node will just be itself. It will be a root and it won&#39;t have anything connecting to it.      Please let me know if I am wrong.     Hey Everyone,      Just a reminder that there will be tutoring available on Monday from 6-7:15 in SN047. Good time to ask last minute exam questions haha.\\xa0      best,   Sam  Class,      We plan to use Gradescope, which in turn, needs your email.      We can generate your email by adding the suffix live.unc.edu to your onyen.      If this email does not work for you, please send mail to:    help401-002-f16&#64;cs.unc.edu    with the subject:    Non-live\\xa0email address         The message body should include your email address      Prasun    Suppose I have some class implementing some interface and it has a read only property called &#34;This&#34; which returns the interface it implements. In the tree structure is the root the class or the interface? And is there a two way arrow between the two? Anyone know how to set up a 2nd constructor for the Angle Class in A5? What Arguments does it take? That is, so the object arguments can be modified from the Avatar Class.  More specifically: Say I am doing Legs = new Angle(); in the Avatar class, now I want to add arguments to it  Legs = new Angle(x,y,height,width);  How would I get this to work in the Angle Class in a 2nd constructor? I&#39;m having trouble understanding 3a in the Old Exam number 1.   I understand how a table works, and I understand how to write code that can instantiate a Set object, but how would I use the Table and aTable types given?      I&#39;m confused because the Set object we&#39;re writing code for seems more simple than the Table - it has only one list of objects, rather than two lists\\xa0objects associated by indices. What would\\xa0an Add method with only one parameter do to a table?      I would understand how to write code for the Table that uses two Sets, however.      Does the add{Object anElement) method use the parameter as the key, and then add the corresponding value to a list?  Anyone planning to get tutoring today? Fall break technically starts today, so didn&#39;t know if anyone was planning to show up.\\xa0        It has come to our attention that some of you are missing the part the of the feedback file where shows you the number of points by feature that you earned. If that is the case for you, please comment below so we know how many people this has happened to.          Are we permitted to reuse this code that&#39;s in the praxis and recitation material or do we have to build our own take on it from scratch?  I can&#39;t feed a quote token into the say method. Do you want us to convert it back to a string? If so, which way would be preferable?         I found out the solution.   ****DISREGARD***\\xa0  When initializing the table in the Command Interpreter, do you we make new Avatar instances or just get them? I tried calling their getters (getArthur(), getGalahad(), etc.) and it gave me NullPointerExceptions.  So this table is supposed to take any arbitrary object associated with a key, right? I&#39;m not supposed to make it a table specifically *for* Avatars or\\xa0come up with a constructor\\xa0that can be initialized to accept only certain types of objects (in this case, Avatars), correct?  The warning I get when rotating a line is   W***Received notification(s) for unknown (possibly invisible or unrecognized atomic-shape) property: Angle of object: grail.scene.Line&#64;4d9ac0b4. Ignoring notification.      Assignment8 works and the line rotates without needing a refresh but for some reason calling the rotate method brings up this warning. And I dont know how to fix it  I got minus five points for Assignment Five due to an &#34;Interactive Run&#34;, does anyone know what this is exactly referring to?    What&#39;s the exact annotation we should use for a map pattern? Simply using &#34;MapPattern&#34; gives an error.  Average is 122/135.      Common mistakes:   Not using correct property name for the array. You should&#39;ve had a method like this in your bean:   public Token[] getTokens() {...}   Not clearing the previous array after setting a new scannedString value.   Your working program should just like\\xa0this:        Do we need an interface for this class given that all of the methods are static? The interface gives compiler errors whenever we use static declarations.      Furthermore, should we define the objects this class creates as properties under property names and make this class a bean pattern?  In the assignment document, it says that methods from superclasses must not be duplicated in subclasses. \\xa0Is it okay to override methods though? \\xa0For instance, my ARotatingLine class extends ABoundedShape (because it has X, Y, Height, Width), but it is necessary for the setHeight and setWidth methods to be overridden because they need to update the Radius and Angle properties. \\xa0This doesn&#39;t count as duplicating methods does it?    Is there an answer key we can use to see if we answered the questions from the practice exam correctly? Also are there any additional resources(such as even older exams) that we could use to help prepare for next week&#39;s exam?\\xa0  In implementing the Table for Assignment 7, I am using StructurePatternNames.MAP_PATTERN as the structure pattern for my Table class, but OE gives me an error saying:      E***Class:main.ATable does not follow declared pattern: Hashmap Pattern. Ignoring pattern declaration. W***Assuming implicit pattern: Hashtable Pattern instead of: Hashmap Pattern      I have defined get and put methods and they seem to be working as expected, and the only other methods I have defined are getters for the Keys ArrayList and Values ArrayList in order to try to use OE to view the table. \\xa0Am I missing some requirement of the MAP_PATTERN?  In A7 is says to show the scanner, bridge scene and Command Interpreter in OE windows. I can show the scanner and bridge scene just fine but the command interpreter gives me a stack overflow error and then the bottom error over and over again   ObjectEditor(Version 22, built on Wed Sep 07 12:53:46 EDT 2016).

Am I not even supposed to be doing that? Or is there just something else wrong  I put the getters of Width and Height in one interface I1, and put the setters of width and height in another interface, I2 that extends I1, which one should I tag BoundedShape?  Can I use generics on Table? Something like MapTable&lt;S,T&gt;.   And in SingletonsCreator, it&#39;s constructed as MapTable&lt;String,Object&gt;;   And can I just make it as MapTable&lt;String,Avatar&gt; when it&#39;s being constructed in SingletonsCreator?      Also, there&#39;s another form of table in assignment 11, a table that maps String to Command objects, used in define, call and thread.\\xa0   Are the two tables the same table? Or are they two tables?   I thought they were two tables and that&#39;s one reason I used generics to implement the table.  Package:\\xa0\\xa0lectures.mvc.properties.atomic   Quiz:MVC Atomic Properties  Class,      1. A couple of you, because of medical issues, could not do the praxes and quizzes within the required time. Also some of you could not submit your completed quizzes because of misunderstanding of the completion time. So I just opened all quizzes until 11 am Thursday. Please complete by then.      2. On Thu I plan to go over the quiz questions that many got wrong. I believe Sakai has a feature that lets me find these questions. More important, please mark those on which you need more elaboration. This will serve as a &#34;revision&#34; before the midterm. T      3. The midterm will cover everything we have done until today. It will cover inheritance but not MVC.      4. I have a practice exam - look at it after you have studied to see how well you have done so, rather than before, as I will not be asking those exact questions and your preparation should not be influenced by the specific questions I ask.      5. As I will not ask these questions, there is no key, which often dissuades students from trying to solve the problems on their own.      6.\\xa0The course keeps evolving, so I do\\xa0not publish exams more than a year old. Also I sometimes involuntarily/voluntarily end up asking questions I have asked before, and I do not want to look at more than one exam to see if I am repeating a question.      7. You are responsible for the material covered through the praxes, quizzes, and my in-class lectures. Anything outside that, which may be in the videos or Word documents, is not something I will test you on.  You should NOT create a new instance of Table for Command Interpretter. Rather, use your factory method class to create this instance and then have the command interpreter utilize that instance. This prevents multiple avatar tables from exisiting which reference different avatars.    Are nested if/else explicitly banned if we&#39;re doing the extra credit portion?    &#34;To demonstrate your work, write a main class that creates instances of the ScannerBean, BridgeScene, and CommandInterpreter classes and asks ObjectEditor to display all three objects. Then, as in assignment 4, animate the result of entering different strings. &#34;      Should we just demo the move and say strings? or should we demo every possible of token we have?    &#34;The command interpreter should recognize the following three commands, and invoke the corresponding methods in the scene. The syntax of these commands syntax is abstractly defined by the following grammar:  \\uf0e0  |   \\uf0e0 say-token quoted-string-token  \\uf0e0 move-token word-token number-token number-token&#34;      Before the Command Interpretter can parse through, does there have to be a word that prefaces it called &#34;Command&#34;? In this case would an invalid command be anything that isn&#39;t Say or Move?\\xa0      &#34;Detect invalid commands entered by the user. On encountering the first unexpected token or the end of input, abandon interpretation of the command and report the error by indicating the unexpected token/end of input you received and the correct token you expected in its stead. You should display this error message by setting a string readonly property, called Errors, of the command interpreter. If you support this feature, put an extra tag in the command interpreter: “ErrorResilientCommandInterpreter”.      What do we define as the &#34;unexpected end&#34; of input? The Command word followed by nothing?     Class,      1. Some of you require an ending space in your scanned string and some of you require there be no ending space. The assignments required you to support an ending space, but we have been testing with both kinds of strings. In A7 it will become hard to know if an error is due to the presence/absence of space or other factors. So the tests will have an ending space. If you can not handle that, just check if the string ends with a space, and iff it does, scan, not the original string, but a substring without the last character.      2. If you get factory methods wrong, we will not be able to test your command interpreter. To test it, we need to set a property in the command interpreter and then see its effect on the bridge scene and without factory methods we cannot get access to the bridge scene\\xa0- it is not a property of the command interpreter. So look carefully at the instructions and ask if you do not understand, You should be instantiating the singleton classes only in the singletons creator, not in the bridge scene or command interpreter and other classes. And if we call the same factory method twice, you should return the same object.      Prasun        In the visitor pattern, the visitor interface behaves so much like functional interface.   If we can just use functional interface, we can avoid creating new classes every time we want a different visitor method. I think it&#39;s pretty convenient and interesting. Can we actually do that?      P.S. Just a little complaint, it&#39;s so bad that Java doesn&#39;t really support Lambda expressions. Functional interface does so much less than Lambda expression... But anyway Java is pure OOP...    Will Local Checks be available before the early submission time?  Are on the web, please let me know of problems as usual  Are the properties for Locatable and BoundedShape editable?\\xa0   Might be some ambiguity in my question, what I am asking if the Locatable and BoundedShape will have setters that can be passed down to their subclasses?  I have my table working.\\xa0 I was wondering where we should &#34;fill&#34; the table with the avatars and keys?\\xa0 Inside of the constructor for the CommandInterpreter class?      Also, should the methods (put &amp; get) inside of the table be static?  Hi,      Those of you who submitted Assignment 4 about a week late- after Monday of the following week (9/26) but by Friday of the following week (9/30) may have received a 5% greater deduction in points than we had said you would. If this is the case, come speak to Andrew so we can fix that.      This does not apply to anyone who submitted it earlier or later than that period.      Thanks,   Semion  Expression e of type E can be assigned to variable v of type V if E IS-A V      In this statement, an expression is any piece of code that yields a value such as :   5   5 &#43; 2   new ArrayList();   (new ArrayList()).size();     I&#39;m trying to set up my table but I wanted to make sure that I understand how its put method works      Is the following an accurate interpretation?      Let   key and value be the already-defined parameters keys be the name of the ArrayList that contains all key elements vals be the name of the ArrayList that contains all value elements      If  the element key exists in keys at index position i, and the element at index i of vals contains some element  Then the element at index i of vals is to be replaced by value      and      If the element key does not exist in keys Then key is added to the next available position in keys at index j and value is added to the index jth position in vals  Are we allowed to use the get(index) method that comes with ArrayList?  I just started my assignment 7 and I missed the last class because of a workshop, so my question may look stupid. What&#39;s the usage of locatable? In the ALocatable class in the package lectures.inheritance.is_a, the setters of x and y are empty and the getters return 0. What&#39;s the purpose of doing this? Thanks!  I have read the pdf and the slides, watched the video and practiced a little bit myself, on the subject of thread and etc. But I&#39;m still confused on a particular question.      Why is Thread.sleep() a static method?      The question rises when I try to implement a OE-independent SleepCommand class, by calling Thread.currentThread().sleep(m_sleepTime) instead of using OE ThreadSupport. However this approach failed since sleep() is a static method, and thus I cannot use m_sleepTime, a instance variable, as a parameter.      How can I fix this problem?  When I run my program I get the CommandInterpreter window to appear, but there is no field to type into.\\xa0 I have to click on a button at the top labeled &#34;CommandInterpreter&#34; next to the button &#34;Common&#34; and select &#34;SetCommand(String)&#34;.\\xa0 When I click on the SetCommand(String) option it opens up another window where it does allow me to enter text.\\xa0 I was wondering what I am doing wrong as I think you are supposed to just type into the first Object Editor window that comes up?    ScreenShot.jpg     Is it possible to make the quiz on MVC due for after fall break? It&#39;s a bit hectic to try to really understand this concept and its intricacies(and thus do well on the quiz) while trying to prepare for our exam.  For the occupied boolean property, where do we put the tag? Before the getter or before the\\xa0variable declaration?  Average: 125/140      Most common problem again is not using correct tag/property/class names.    Are we permitted to post our answers to the practice exam and discuss?  Class,      I received two requests to open that\\xa0two quizzes that were due yesterday\\xa0- the excuse was that there was already an assignment due and the students did not see the date.      This is not really a good excuse, after the fact, as the students who finished in time are at a disadvantage. I opened the quizzes last week for students with medical reasons, which is a good reason, and advertised it so that people who happened to notice the open quizzes do not have an advantage.      Nonetheless, I have opened the two quizzes for late submission. Those who have already submitted get a second chance to improve their grade, so hopefully this is fair to everyone.      Also the MVC quiz deadline is postponed by a week as requested      Prasun       For A5 assuming I am creating all the images. The proper way to set it up is to create a new object for each image and then a new getImage for each image? Unless there is a more convenient way to do this I am just checking. This would I guess also be the way to create multiple lines, string classes etc.   In our approach method, do we have the knight &#34;march&#34; like they do in the video or can we just move them to the knight area? Also is this method apart of our bridgescene or should it be apart of main?    Average: 166   Total without EC: 185      Common Mistakes:   -Not having a single parameter constructor   -Printing &lt;Token&gt; instead of the actual token object   -Improper tagging and naming of classes/properties   -If you create a package, it must be under grail or mp or it will be seen as an illegal import          According to the feedback file I had lost points for not having screenshots but I had uploaded a zip folder alongside my assignment(named Assignment 3 Screenshots to clear confusion) as there was more than one screenshot. Was this an error in the grader?    If this class is to implement only one interface and is supposed to be extended by all of the token classes, will this only apply to our WordToken class and all subsequent subclasses? Otherwise our Number token classes will require a String property for &#34;Value&#34; in place of the traditional int and token classes such as QuoteString will need to have Value properties where they previously did not.      Finally, should the classes that use inherieteance also implement the common \\xa0interface?  Class,      A6 checks are on the web with the usual caveats. For those who did extra credit in A4, please check A4 checks also and let us know of any problems with the checks.      Prasun  Hello Everyone,      Just a reminder there will be tutoring available today and Wednesday in SN 047 from 6-7ish. Someone replied so tutoring will be 6-7ish both these days.      best,   Samuel     For the say method, it is necessary that we know which knight is in the area (i.e. which knight whose utterance we need to change). \\xa0We could figure this out by checking x and y coordinates of all of the knights each time &#39;say&#39; is run (or at least each time it is run and KnightTurn = true) or we could define an additional property KnightInArea (or something like that) which tracks which knight (if any) is in the knight standing area. \\xa0Are we allowed to define such a property?  I am wondering where I should put all the animation code.\\xa0 Should we animate the avatars inside of the constructor of the BridgeScene class?\\xa0 Or should it be done in the main class?\\xa0      Right now in my constructor for the BridgeScene I set all the avatars to their beginning positions, create the gorge image and the shapes for the knights and guard to stand in.      Should all of the &#34;say&#34; commands and &#34;approach&#34; be written inside the main method?\\xa0  I am still uncertain if I am structuring my Avatar class correctly; I have a constructor which takes the head image shape as its argument, and I initialize it, along with the other body parts (arms, legs, torso, and the string shape). Then in BridgeScene, I initialize the avatar for all five characters, and have getters for each of them (all per specs). Then after this is where I&#39;m unsure between a few different next steps: am I supposed to use setters for different parts of each body part to set their x and y values to connect them inside of the character getters in BridgeScene, or some other way?\\xa0  Class,      The packages are:      lectures.inheritance.is_a;   lectures.arrays.collections_kinds;      The quizzes are:   Inheritance &#34;IS-A&#34;   Kinds of Collections         You should do them in the order given. They are relatively short, so you should be able to catch up this week.      Prasun  Class,      In response to some of the Piazza comments, I have made some edits:      1. I have taken Matt&#39;s suggestion and put in an extra iproperty to return the interacting Knight. You are not required to have it, as I am suggesting this late.      2. I have clarified that if you do animations (for fun) the code is in the avatar but called from main.      Prasun    &#34;To put some structure in this part of your assignment: implement a class tagged “Token” that implements the common interface, and make all of the other token classes direct or indirect subclasses of this class. Thus, the new super class has the same tag as the common interface. Similarly, the command token classes will be subclasses of the word class and will simply define a constructor that calls the superclass constructor.&#34;      Does this mean all of our subclasses of token and word should have the &#34;Token&#34; tag?  In VectorArrayListUser you will not be able to step into the add() function unless you have the JDK. \\xa0I&#39;ve attached a couple of screenshots showing what happens when you do this. \\xa0First you step into Integer.class, then return, then step into ArrayList.class.      Since we are marking this property&#39;s visibility as false, should we still include it under property names?  Checks for A4 was wrongly taking points out for\\xa0the quote array test.      Checks for A6 was printing mistakes but the credit was incorrectly given.      The new jar addresses these two issues.      Make sure you refresh the project after copying the new jar    Are we required to do these parts of the assignment if it&#39;s not explicitlly said that we should complete them? For example a5 had explicit instructions to have our avatars march as part of our demo while a6 doesn&#39;t say anything about these additional features in our demo.  I am getting this error:      W***Implicitly editable property: inputof class class main.ScannerBean not considered editable as it is not in editable property names list.         I have nothing called &#34; inputof &#34; in my program.\\xa0 I was wondering how this error message in the console can be fixed.     I named my Avatar&#39;s stringshape property &#34;StringShape&#34; instead of &#34;Text&#34; as Assignment 5 made no explicit instruction to do so. Will I lose points for this/ Is it worth resubmitting late over?    Checkstyle is giving me an error that my bridgescene class is missing a setText() call. However, this call is made in my &#34;say&#34; method.      Furthermore, it appears that I got 0 points in the local checks for the scroll function although my demo shows that it visually works. I believe this is due to the fact that local checks uses the positioning of the arms to be the location of the avatar. If we used the upper left corner of the head as the location and simply moved the arms and body in context to how the Head moves, will we still get extra credit?  It&#39;s required that every class implement one single interface.   Does this mean a subclass can only implement interfaces that are either implemented by its super class(es), or extend the interface(s) that are implemented by its super class(es)?  When I do the EC part of the ClearableHistory, I assigned each token to both the token array and the clearable history. My object editor looks fine, but the console gives me some errors saying something like\\xa0 &#34;  E***Object:grail.Tokens.Word&#64;58594a11 displayed multiple times with following references:     \\xa0[AScannerBean.tokens.8, AScannerBean.tokenList.8]  &#34;.\\xa0 I guess this is because each token is stored twice. Is this error fine? For your reference, the following two images are screenshots of my object editor and the console. Thanks!                   Class,      Today we will have a lecture on inheritance and collections - I expect it to take most if not all of the class time.      Which means you will have many opportunities to answer questions.      The last time I looked a little less than half of the class has filled in the class discussion quiz.      Let me emphasize again why class participation is important.      In exams, grading constrains the kind of questions that can be asked - it is difficult yo get good answers for and grade discussion/essay/conceptual/definition questions. However, ultimately, what you learn here has to be named and defined, especially if someone asks you what you learned in an interview.      It is for this reason that your grade depends on class discussion.      To put things in perspective, each assignment is about 3% (35 percent for twelve assignments). Class discussion is going to have at least a 3% weight\\xa0- it is part of the 15% I allocated for classwork (praxes, recitation, class discussion). I left it fluid because I wanted to see how much discussion actually happens. \\xa0But 3% is the minimum I will allocate for it, and how much you get will depend not only on if you ever answered a question but also how many times you did so and what kind of answer you gave, which is why documenting what you did is important. I know there is stage fright, but a question such as &#34;what did you learn&#34; surely is easy to answer and get some practice overcoming this fright!      I keep repeating this stuff in the hope it will make a difference ...         Prasun  For moving a knight into the standing area, how would you create a method that lets you pick and choose which knight you wish to move in object editor? Currently, my method for moving the avatar into the standing area keeps erroring and forcing me to create a completely new avatar in the object editor window when I try to use the method through OE interface. I cannot choose from avatars already made.     I&#39;m making the approach scene question and I&#39;m having trouble. if the knights are in different areas (left side of the bridge), am I suppose to come up with with general animation code (move method) that&#39;ll move it to the knight area? I feel that won&#39;t work since the knights are in different locations.  It might be a little bit early to ask this question.   But can I make the return type of ParseNumber Integer instead of int?   This way it can return null and is more suitable for dealing with errors.  If I didn&#39;t get it wrong, there seems to be a little typo in HW11 EC &#34;More Recursive Descent Parsing&#34;:      in the grammar of RotateLeftArm/RotateRightArm (grammar 10/11), a word-token (representing the name of the avatar whose arm is to be rotated) seems to be missing.  Are tags alone sufficient for interfaces? It seems like we have only been asked to include structurepatterns, propertynames, and editablepropertynames in classes and not interfaces. Are these other annotations appropriate in interfaces as well?  So in your assignment you say &#34;implement a class tagged &#34;Token&#34; that implements the common interface, and make all the other token classes direct or indirect subclasses of this class&#34; Which is saying that you need to put &#64;Tags({&#34;Token&#34;}) in the Token superclass. \\xa0Then it says &#34;Thus the new super class has the same tag as the common interface&#34;. Which is saying the super class now has the same tag the common interface has. The common interface has\\xa0&#64;Tags({&#34;Word&#34;, &#34;Number&#34;, &#34;Plus&#34;, etc.}). What &#64;Tag({}) do we put in the superclass then?      CommonInterface.java   &#64;Tags({&#34;Word&#34;, &#34;Number&#34;, &#34;Plus&#34;, etc.})      TokenSuperclass.java   &#64;Tag({&#34;&#34;}) \\xa0&lt;----?  I&#39;m doing HW8 right now and took a brief look at further homeworks;   in HW 8 and other future relevant homeworks, we no longer have to notify the Observer on the change of &#34;Occupied&#34; and &#34;KnightTurn&#34;, and in particular &#34;InteractingKnight&#34;, right?      (Since Occupied and KnightTurn not really need be displayed, and InteractingKnight is already been observed as one of the knight or guard. Is this correct?)  Hey Everyone,      I am going on vacation Monday so I will be moving office hours to Wednesday from 6-7:30 in SN047 and Thursday same times. Moving back in the week also makes sense to give you time to ask questions about the exam. If you have been studying for the exam on the 18th and have any conceptual questions this would be a great time to ask.\\xa0      best,   Sam        In the EC alternative part, are we still painting the entire scene in one JFrame, using one single ObservableBridgeScenePainter, but with 5 different view objects?   If the answer is yes, I don&#39;t see why the order of view objects registering to the painter affects the order of drawing, since the repaint() method will always be called and the entire scene is actually repainted no matter what changes.          If the user types the letter ‘o’ then all avatars should return to their original positions.\\xa0   What does &#34;original position&#34; stands for? The position before last move? Or the position when the controller was constructed?        For our Avatar composite shape, should our String property be\\xa0 called  &#34;StringShape&#34; or be of type &#34;StringShape&#34;?    ObjectEditor asks me to define the getters of my two rotating line shapes that make up my angle shape and thus won&#39;t display. However, I&#39;ve defined the getter and I&#39;ve labeled it properly in the PropertyNames section. Any reason why OE won&#39;t recognize this?  Class,      We will do inheritance and collections in an integrated manner - so this will be looong,\\xa0taking both days of the week.      Sakai Quiz: Inheritance and Collections   JavaTeaching Package:lectures.inheritance      The material is complicated but essential to understanding how to program in object-oriented languages.      Prasun  Is it ok if we don&#39;t define a constructor for the bridgescene class that does not take arguments? That is, we only define one constructor that takes arguements for each avatar?  Average: 91/120      Common mistakes:       -Not using correct property names!!!    I see many people making this mistake. It&#39;s important to use the exact property name we give you. So in this assignment we asked you to &#34;create an editable scannedstring property&#34;. This directly translates to two methods:      public String getScannedString() {...}   public void setScannedString(String myString) {...}      and these tags:      &#64;PropertyNames({&#34;ScannedString&#34;})   &#64;EditablePropertyNames({&#34;ScannedString&#34;}).      -Not submitting screenshots of you playing with the debug mode.    -Incorrect program structure. Your main class should always be called AssignmentN (uppercase &#39;A&#39;) where N is the assignment number. It should be in a package called &#34;main&#34; (lowercase).    -Your other classes should be tagged. In that case it doesn&#39;t matter what the class name is.     How is extra credit calculated into the total grade?   So sakai grade book has assignments 35%, fudge 10%;   does this mean the total score in assignments cannot exceed the full score, and the part (caused by ec) exceeding the full score is counted in the fudge part?   My words might be a little bit unorganised but I&#39;m just curious how the extra credits are calculated.  Class,      They are on the web with the usual caveats.      Scaling the head gets you more extra credit though you get extra credit even if you do not scale it.      I noticed that some of your displays are really small on Windows machines. You can invoke the following code to scale your ObjectEditor display:      ObjectEditor.setDenseMagnification(3.0);  Assignment5Suite.main(args);      Prasun  As far as I&#39;m concerned, there are multiple ways to scale some image-like or picture-like thing in Java.   Is there a preference on the choice? And can we use other classes other than ImageIcon to do the job?  Class,   If you have lost points in assignments, make sure:      1. You understand the exact reason for it, by posting on Piazza (preferable) or talking to us, as the error messages can be cryptic.\\xa0      2. You do not lose multiple times for the same mistake, in different assignments. You will have to keep track of this, and report the problem to the TA who graded your assignment.      Prasun        Class,      I think I have said this before, but it is important to reiterate this given how many of you are making mistakes CheckStyle would have caught. (Remember localchecks\\xa0do not use CheckStyle output, but our final checks do.)      Some checks are done automatically when the file is saved.      Others are done by explicitly selecting the project and executing Check Code with CheckStyle.      Most of the checks I have written are executed explicitly.      Activating checkstyle\\xa0does not achieve the same effect      Prasun        What are the steps of importing an image found online or saved in the computer into the code again? I can&#39;t seem to figure out how to do so. Also, is it required for all the components to be used, or are we allowed to use one or two of the shapes?  In the Inheritance praxis, in the class AnInheritingStringDatabase, there is a typo in one of the question, with it reading\\xa0   If interface I extends interface J, and class C implements I, then A must * implement the methods: * (a) declared only in I. * (b) declared only in J. * (c) declared in I and J.   while it should read   If interface I extends interface J, and class C implements I, then C must * implement the methods: * (a) declared only in I. * (b) declared only in J. * (c) declared in I and J.  In local checks 5, there is a somewhat misleading error message. When the suite gives out 0 points and says that the error is &#34;NullPointerException,&#34; it is very likely that the cause is a missing &#64;Tag in the interface and implementation classes, and not lack of initialization. Hope this helps.  If eclipse gives you an error when you use ObjectEditor.setDenseMagnification(3.0); in the local check, remove oeall22.jar should fix it.  Class,      As some of you pointed out today, the course syllabus (which was submitted before classes started)\\xa0says:\\xa0 Submitting it on the Wednesday of that week will result in a 5% extra credit. Submitting it on the Monday (Friday) of the next week will result in a penalty of 5% (15%).\\xa0      However, the pdf of the PPT I showed seems to say, 5% and 10%. What I intended to say was that an extra 10 percent is lost by going to Friday. A student and I tried to listen to the actual words I said, the voice level was low, and we could not hear the word extra.      Those who discovered this discrepancy should have pointed this our earlier - it is too late to regrade A2 and A1 (no one complained the late penalty on A1). But for A3 and A4 we will make it 10%.\\xa0      As I mentioned in class, we wil\\xa0give you until Friday night (tomorrow) for A3 late submission. If you do so, you will lose only 15% instead of 20% and you will get manual grading of the assignment.\\xa0      As I mentioned in an earlier post, the A3 checks will lighting up green even if you had mistakes - you needed to look at the log. I will try and fix the checks and post a new version as soon I get some time, before tonight hopefully.      Prasun           Hi Professor, I forgot to remove the classes I created to run the checkstyle from my main package for assignment 3 and 4. Will this cause losing points?\\xa0     I just uploaded a new local checks\\xa0jar that should catch more errors\\xa0      A3 is worth 200 points, btw ...  As per previous assignments, do you still want us to place the annotations on classes that weren&#39;t necessarily specified? So for example:      Bridge Scene Class:   &#64;StructurePattern(&#34;Bean Pattern&#34;)   &#64;Tags ({&#34;BridgeScene&#34;})   &#64;PropertyNames({&#34;Arthur&#34;,&#34;Lancelot&#34;, &#34;Robin&#34;, &#34;Galahad&#34;, &#34;Guard&#34;})      Bridge Scene Interface:   &#64;Tags\\xa0({&#34;BridgeScene&#34;})  Hi Professor, currently I set the height and width of the hands and legs to be same to the head. In this way, when I scale the avatar, I only need to scale the head. The other body parts are proportional to that. Is this OK?  Class,      See my interaction with Conrad on why the number tests in A3 may alternate between passing and failing:\\xa0 https://piazza.com/class/iqv0bsb3p2i3ch?cid=158       I have updated the local checks jar to change the student input data (we have been focussing on grader input data) so you should no longer get this alternating behavior.      Also I have cleaned up the output to make tracing easier. The message you get with incorrect output identifies which pattern was not matched, as does the console \\xa0output.      The A5 missing tag message should be better.      I was told that in A4, if your program expects no ending space, you get no credit at least for the quote case. I have made a change that affects all cases - let me know if there is a problem.      Ignore the locatable test in A4, I am in the middle of adding rotating line to A4.      Prasun  I&#39;m having an error when running the Local Checks.\\xa0 I get the full points awarded after I click on the part that is missing points.\\xa0 I have included a video of the error.       https://vid.me/AoqR      We were looking at a student&#39;s\\xa0A3 and in their\\xa0Common interface they\\xa0had multiple &#64;Tags({}) lines. This MUST\\xa0be combined\\xa0like this: &#64;Tags({“one”,”two”,”three”}) or it makes our life difficult.      It should NOT be like this:   &#64;Tags({&#34;one&#34;})   &#64;Tags({&#34;two&#34;})   &#64;Tags({&#34;three&#34;})      Note: if your code compiles (no red underlines), you can disregard this.\\xa0      So if you did this on A3 or after, resubmit today.  Make sure if you use a for loop (to make the avatar move nicely) in your main method to demo your Assignment 5 don&#39;t let the pixels being added exceed the width and height of the ObjectEditor window. It will throw errors.\\xa0         - Just trying to help out!  Just FYI, screenshots must be outside your zip folder for us to see them. So alongside your zip folder on sakai. This is only 10/200 points so it&#39;s not a big deal, but just for the future.      So you should only submit one ZIP or we may not find your project.        If we submit Assignment 4 after today but before it&#39;s graded, will our assignment be graded manually or automatically?\\xa0    I get this error whenever I run my main method. It does the movement of the avatars correctly and even after the error shows, it still keeps moving the avatars. The treepanel shows weird output as well. It starts to hide the values. I tried googling it and I couldn&#39;t find anything.

However, I can&#39;t seem to find where the assignment says that our Line class&#39; implementation must include a getX()/getY() method? My program seems to fulfill the necessary requirements but my implementation seems to be incorrect somehow? Any clarification would be appreciated.

In the part of refactoring token code, is only required for  Token classes  to implement one single interface (for each class), or it&#39;s required for  all classes , including Gorge,Avatar,Angle,etc.   P.S. I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s only meant for Token classes, and the wording is quite clear in the PDF, but I just want to make sure.   The reason I&#39;m asking this question is:   first, since Java provides the functionality of implementing multiple interfaces, why don&#39;t we make use of it;   second, for classes that represent certain graph object, like Gorge, Angle, etc, it&#39;s really convenient to implement multiple interfaces, in particular, Gorge;   third, if I have to make certain classes only implement one interface, I have to actually create interfaces that extend some other interfaces but have nothing else itself, which seems to me not efficient.   Thank you.  Sakai is not allowing me to submit the recitation 5 assignment late? is it possible to change this?  One of the reasons for the delayed grading of Hw1 (which is being regraded as we speak) is that a small minority of you has not paid heed to:\\xa0    \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Be sure to follow the conventions for the name and package of the main class.       The conventions are that the main class for AssignmentN is in the package  main  and \\xa0named  AssignmentN .      We could give you a zero for all tests that depend on this, and in A1 all do. This would mirror what happens in the real world when you do not follow instructions and many of my colleagues in this university and others have told me that this is a lesson worth learning. The cost to us of manually recovering from this mistake is very high. We have to unzip your code, change the names, and all of its references.      However, we feel it is a pity if we penalize you so heavily, at least for the first assignment.      For now, please reply to this message immediately if you have not followed the guidelines, telling us the name of your main class in each assignment \\xa0you have already submitted if it has deviated from what is expected. We may be able to change our code to look for those. Do not send us email.      In future, the only recourse you will have is to resubmit it late and lose 20% credit.      If you are the kind who has trouble\\xa0remembering what are admittedly \\xa0trivial but important details, then you should run local runtime checks and also run checkstyle. There is really no excuse for such mistakes given the resources at your disposal.              Class,      I strongly recommend you read the discussion\\xa0 Runtime checks throwing errors \\xa0to see if your A3 solution works.      As that discussion shows, the bean tests can give full points even if you have mistakes. So look at the console to see if\\xa0anything is amiss; my responses explain the messages you might see,      In general the runtime checks are incomplete and may give false positives and negatives as I have mentioned several times.      Prasun    My code simply uses the setScannedString method(as this is what does the scanning as per A2 instructions) in the main class. Is it worth going back and incorporating a constructor for this class that sets the input using the constructor and losing points? (And EC for turning in early)  I&#39;m getting an error message &#34;StructurePattern cannot be resolved to a type&#34; that points to the tag we&#39;re supposed to put at the top of the Scanner Bean Class:\\xa0   &#64;StructurePattern(StructurePatternNames.BEAN_PATTERN)      My code was working before I tried to put the tags in. Has anyone else had this problem?    My original returned assignment had 131/116 for the extra credit but it appears to have been removed now. Is this an error with Sakai?  How are we supposed to call the object editor in Assignment 4?\\xa0 Should it be inside of its own class with a main method?     Hello Everyone,      I have had a conflict arise so I will not be able to hold tutoring today (Monday 9-19) at the usual times. Most people have been coming on Wednesday anyway, so hopefully you can come then. Feel free to email me if you have questions.\\xa0      Again Wednesday will be the normal times.\\xa0      best,   Sam     The document for Assignment 4 suggests we use String equals() or equalsIgnoreCase() methods. \\xa0Are we required to explicitly use these, or would something like a switch/case statement be okay? \\xa0i.e.:      switch (token.toLowercase()) {   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0case &#34;move&#34;: \\xa0...   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0case &#34;say&#34;: ...   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0.   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0.   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0.   }      Also, if we are doing the extra credit, should we check word tokens for &#34;rotaterightarm&#34;, &#34;define&#34;, etc.?  For Assignment 4, should our main method directly animate the scanner and then the line, or is it okay if we write and call methods (i.e. animatingScanner() and animatingLine()) which do that?  Class,      Please review the material on properties in case you are still confused about the difference between properties and instance variables. A property can be defined completely independently of instance variables, it is not an instance variable with a getter and setter as many think. A stored property is indeed that.      This is one of the most important praxis you will do and will make make your head hurt a bit. The corresponding assignment (A5) may well be the hardest assignment also (relative to what you know at the start of the assignment) and will make you grow in a new dimension.      Package:\\xa0lectures.composite.objects_shapes   Quiz: Composite Objects - Shapes  Class,      I have made some corrections.      Again, you should restart Eclipse after replacing the files.      Also, my checks do not execute automatically when you save a file (lest they bomb). You have to explicitly select project and ask for checking using the right click menu.      Prasun        First, is the local check A1 suite the actual grading tool used to determine the actual grade?   Second, there seems to be a change in the grade. The grading feedback attached to the assignment submission shows a different score from the score on sakai-gradebook. Is there an updated version of the feedback?      And, the extra credit due date is Wednesday but usually the local check is not updated on Wednesday. Should we just take the risk ourselves?  I&#39;m having trouble importing the recitation 4 code . When i run the driver program, i get this red bus. Can anyone tell me how to properly import the code?  2 questions about interpretation of the assignment      1st,   When they say [&gt;  Thus, if the scanned string  contains the word “MoVE”, you would create an instance of the token class tagged  “Move” and not an instance of the class tagged “Word”,    ] am i supposed to send stuff like &#34;BobMoveWow&#34; to the move class?        Will there be a runtime checks update for Assignment 4 before the early submission time?  A beta version has been uploaded with the usual caveats.           There are numerous errors in checkstyles where, for example, it will say that the getter of a property isn&#39;t defined, even though it is clearly there. Should we just ignore these or will this cost us points?  If the compact array is being created in the scanner setter method (not a global or instance variable), how can I make a getter for it since it is not global?  Class.      I just uploaded a new version of local checks that should take care of input with ending space but I did not have a suitable project \\xa0to test it.      Also last night I uploaded a new checkstyle\\xa0jar and A4 checks file that should give no false \\xa0errors. If you have downloaded them since, ignore this message.      Prasun        As defined by the interface of the rotation line, Angle / Radius are clearly not properties, as there are not getters defined for them.   Get error message from ObjectEditor on implicit property, use &#64;Visible(false) in front of getter to fix. No getter, and no use putting before setter. What to do?   Thank you.  1. Are we able to use the Arrays.toString(array) method to print out the arrays?\\xa0      2. The getter method of the Tokens property will return array object code correct? because at least on mine it did. I&#39;m really sure on what other ways you can print out the array similar to the example you gave in the assignment sheet.  Quiz:\\xa0Composite Objects- Trees, DAGs, and Graphs   Package:\\xa0lectures.composite.tree_dag_graph_objects_windows      Should take about 30 minutes  Class,      I have tried to make this point many times, but looking at some A2 assignments, at least some of you have not understood it clearly.      If I say define a property called ScannedString, it is not sufficient or necessary to define a variable called ScannedString.      You can call the variable anything. It is good to, of course, give it the same name as the property, but all variable names start with lowercase. So a good name is : scannedString.      I always start a property name with upper case to distinguish it from a variable.      And you need a variable only for stored properties. SOme properties are not stored.      But you do need a getter and maybe even a setter based on whether the property is editable or not.      If you do not follow these conventions, our grader cannot understand your code, and these conventions are made for code understanding.      So in A2 many of you will be losing a good chunk of the 25 points for the Bean test. We have to hand grade your assignment to give you partial credit for it.      Localchecks\\xa0should have told you about this mistake.      A3, A4 build on this property, so please use local checks before submitting them.      Prasun        Class,       Method tags should be put both in the classes and interfaces that declare them.         So if you\\xa0are doing extra credit, tag the rotate method both in the line interface and class.      This point was not made clearly in A4, so the early submitters will not lose points for this, but the late submitters\\xa0please do pay heed to this rule to reduce the manual grading effort.   A        Prasun  My only import is Editable property names, not sure if that all I need. And what is suppose to go in the parenthesis for each one of the &#64; things. For propertynames should the &#34;input&#34; and &#34;value&#34; be the name of my variables? what about StructurePatter?  I keep getting a negative height. I make my PolarPoint instance and set the X and Y of the point to the height and width. It doesn&#39;t show a line in ObjectEditor. Mainly because the upper-left is (0,0). And with the angle being negative (height), it goes up and out of screen. How can I get it to show correctly?  So if the grade for an assignment is not yet on Sakai, how do we know if an improvement we made was worth the late penalty?      Also, is it possible for a resubmission to lower our grade, or will the highest of the submitted grades be counted?  When I have my Assignment4 class configured to scan a String and print the elements of the compactArray, it works and i receive full credit in the runtime checks. However, when I instantiate an\\xa0OEFrame, the compiler throws the following error:   W***Value: null of Root.Tokens not in range. Exception in thread &#34;main&#34; java.lang.StackOverflowError \\tat bus.uigen.oadapters.ObjectAdapter.getElideComponentWidth(ObjectAdapter.java:2207) \\tat bus.uigen.oadapters.ObjectAdapter.getElideComponentWidth(ObjectAdapter.java:2207)   I have tried to figure out how to address this error, but I am not sure how to interpret it.      Any ideas?  If we are using inheritance and making our command classes extend the word class, does the word class also have to have tags that reflect the command classes that extend it (similar to how an interface has tags of the names of the classes that implement it)?    How exactly are we supposed to separate packages in Assignment 5? I understand the reasoning behind it given the complexity of the project but I do not understand why we need additional packages mp and grail under main or what they&#39;re even supposed to accomplish. Can we simply break down the packages into other divisions? If not which packages fall under main, mp, and grail respectively?  Suppose I am making a class AHeadImage that I want to be able to use as either a scaled\\xa0or unscaled\\xa0image. \\xa0So, you could call either:      AHeadImage newHead = new AHeadImage(&#34;galahad.jpg&#34;, 100, 100, 50, 50) \\xa0   (50x50 image of galahad at (100,100))      AHeadImage newHead = new AHeadImage(&#34;galahad.jpg&#34;, 100, 100)   (unscaled image of galahad at (100,100))      I can see how do do this using Icon.getIconHeight() and Icon.getIconWidth() (like one of the praxes did) in the second constructor. \\xa0Are we allowed to use this import on Assignment 5? \\xa0Is there a different way I\\xa0should do it instead?  &#34;This shape consists of two (possibly rotating/moving) readonly line properties, named LeftLine and RightLine, whose upper left corner is always at the same location, which is also considered the location of the angle.&#34;   ---Quoted from assignment 5 spec      Does the upper left corner in the text above refer to the\\xa0upper left corner of the whole thing?\\xa0   The reason I&#39;m asking is that in the rotation ec of assn4, I made the rotating origin the &#34;upper left corner&#34;, and the width and height can actually be negative. That way it&#39;s easier to program and easier to understand.   So in this assignment, can I still just make the origin of the angle the &#34;upper left corner&#34;, and the width of the left arm is simply negative?    If we had implemented the ability to check for errors in our prior assignment, should we create an instance for these errors based on what type of token they fall into or should we just bypass this and report the error?  Do we just reuse the prior tags from assignment 2 for our interface and class of the scannerbean?  Reminder. Tutoring will be available in SN047 from 6-7:15 Monday and Wednesday.\\xa0     Is AnExtendibleTreeWalker deprecated in Checkstyle 6.5?   This is the error produced when I attempt to use the local checks file:   cannot initialize module unc.tools.checkstyle.AnExtendibleTreeWalker - Unable to instantiate unc.tools.checkstyle.AnExtendibleTreeWalker cannot initialize module unc.tools.checkstyle.AnExtendibleTreeWalker - Unable to instantiate unc.tools.checkstyle.AnExtendibleTreeWalker      The Global Google Checks works fine.

Start and hopefully finish praxis:      Package: lectures.ui\\xa0   Saka Quiz:\\xa0User Interface and Annotations      It took Semion 30 minutes to finish the praxis, and this one is less dense conceptually than the last two praxes!  Will there be a runtime checks update for Assignment 3 before the early submission date tomorrow?  Hello everyone,      As those of you who have been to my office hours know, my office is tiny. It is in fact so small that I have been asked to move the location of my office hours to avoid disrupting the hallway outside.      My office hours will stay the same time, but from now on they will be in:   SN 252 on Tuesday   SN 155 on Friday      This information will be updated on the class website soon.      Sorry for the inconvenience, but I&#39;m happy you guys are coming to office hours!      Kind regards,   Semion  Class,      I heard from a student yesterday that &#34;my program &#34;works&#34;, do I need interfaces?&#34;   yes your input/output behavior can work without interfaces, instances, named constants etc, but your program does not necessarily meet the style constraints.      You have to use interfaces extensively in A3. Classes must define interfaces and variables must be typed using interfaces. I just saw one solution that forgot to define an \\xa0interface for the scanner bean. So watch out for this mistake.      I just uploaded a new unccheckstyle jar ( UNCChecks_6.5.0.jar &#xfffd;), which you need to   put in the dropins/plugins folder and\\xa0and a new A3 checks file ( Checks File ). Start eclipse again after you have downloaded them in the previous folders (you do not have to create a new A3 configuration). These should help uncover interface mistakes. Let me know if there is a problem with them - I have had only a few minutes to debug them.      Prasun  I opened it for another day because a student misread the deadline.\\xa0  Class,      I just uploaded a new version of it:\\xa0 Comp401LocalChecks.jar (Library)    It has an A3Suite.      As usual tests may be missing or give false positives and negatives, let us know of any errors.               When I print out the instance, does it need to be somewhat similar to what is on the assignment? I know it says it will vary but I want to make sure since mine is quite different ( main.Word&#64;330bedb4 ).     Class,      The packages are:   lectures.graphics   lectures.arrays      The quizzes are Graphics and Arrays LifeCycle      Most of you, especially those who have done Java before, can probably do most of the Arrays LifeCycle quiz without doing the praxis, though I recommend you do the part that involves use of the debugger.      The graphics part is conceptually very simple but new. I recommend you definitely do the praxis on it.      Together, they should take about an hour to do. You can use the other fifteen minutes to complete the ui praxis.      The discovery-based praxes are yet another means at your disposal to learn the material. Based on talking to you, I know some of you are using other means such as the \\xa0word docs,\\xa0ppt pdfs, ppt videos,, which is fine. Do what works best for you.\\xa0The reason we are working so hard on the praxes is that they probably help\\xa0you remember the material. Ultimately, the assignments will be the most effective method for \\xa0 retaining the information.  The question is:   Which is true:   \\xa0A.\\xa0An interface contains only headers of methods (the code between curly braces after a method header).   \\xa0B.\\xa0An interface contains both headers and bodies of methods.      The information inside the parenthesis is supposed to be part of option B not A, as it is describing what the body of a method is.\\xa0  Hi everyone,      We will probably go over this briefly tomorrow during recitation, but a couple notes about doing Assignment 3:      1. Be aware that it is possible to have empty interfaces (interfaces that do not specify any methods). As you would expect, you just don&#39;t put anything inside the curly braces.   \\xa0   *Edit: as you will see below, that point is not necessarily needed for this assignment.       2. You will need an interface for every class you have in the Assignment (except the &#34;Assignment3&#34; main class, I suppose), plus you will have a generic Token interface. All of your token classes will implement two interfaces (the generic and specific). For some of those token classes, the second interface they implement will be empty, since they don&#39;t have any special methods.       *Edit: I apologize, I totally misunderstood this part of the assignment. While you can have empty interfaces that are specific to each token, you do not need them. In addition, while every class will implement at least one interface, not every class will need to have an interface unique to itself. Corrected note below:      2. Every class you have in the Assignment (except for the &#34;Assignment3&#34; main class), will implement at least one interface. Most of them will just implement a generic token interface that you are required to create. Some of them (that have additional properties besides the input) will implement an additional, second interface. As a result, every public method your classes have will also be in some interface.      3. None of your  variables  should be of a specific class type (besides the classes you didn&#39;t create, like Scanner and String). They will instead be of an interface type.      The difference is this:      //Box is an interface, GiftBox is a class   Box myBox = new GiftBox() //Do this, because myBox is of an interface type   GiftBox myBox = new GiftBox() //Don&#39;t do this, because myBox is of a class type      4. In some cases, you might want to access the methods of an object even though the variable that points to it is of a type that doesn&#39;t have those methods. For example, GiftBox may implement both the Box and the Gift interface. (&#34;public class GiftBox implements Box, Gift&#34;). Say you have, as before:      Box myBox = new GiftBox();      You can do things like:   myBox.flatten();   myBox.doAnotherBoxThing()      But what if you want to do something else that GiftBox can do, such as .unwrap(), which comes from the Gift interface? Box does not have a .unwrap() method, so myBox.unwrap() will result in an error. However, we can tell Java that myBox is a Gift using &#34;(Gift)myBox&#34;. So we can do:      ((Gift)myBox).unwrap();      You could have also done &#34;((GiftBox)myBox).unwrap()&#34;, but we just said that we have to work with interfaces, so don&#39;t do that.  Class,      For local checks to work, there are constraints on where you call new Scanner (System.in) and how many times you call it.      1. It should be called a single time.   2. It should be called after main is called.      So if you are not doing a recursive processInput, declare the Scanner variable in processInput before the loop is called as in:      static void processInput() {   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Scanner scanner = new Scanner (System.in);   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0//loop   }      If you are doing a recursive processInput, you cannot use the solution above as each call will create a new instance of Scanner. So in this case make it a static variable but iniitalize it in main() as in:      static Scanner scanner;   public static void main(String[] args) {   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0scanner = new Scanner (System.in);   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0// rest of main   }      This is only for local runtime checks\\xa0to work. Our grader will simulate your environment, so you will not\\xa0lose points for not following these constraints as long as you\\xa0are sure about your code.      Prasun        In completing my recitation assignment, I have run into a null pointer exception in line 6 of the Driver class, &#34; ObjectEditor.edit(filter);&#34; (I know we aren&#39;t usually supposed to post code segments in here, but this code was given.) Additionally, the console says &#34;No factory registered for Bean Pattern&#34;.\\xa0      I really have no idea how to resolve this error, as I believe my code should execute properly, and I am not sure how to resolve this runtime error.      Thanks  Someone pointed out to me today that in Assignment 2, the scanString method and IndexOf method were supposed to be in the Bean class and were to be implemented there. \\xa0How I set up my program, I had processInput (from the main class (&#34;Assignment2&#34;) call the setter in the Bean class, which would then set the values by calling back to the main class where scanString and indexOf were located.      My question is how much credit would I lose for this mistake, because I can correct it and resubmit my program by the end of today at a late penalty of 10%. \\xa0 Would this mistake be worth more than 10%?  I thought the Interface quiz was due tonight. Is there anyway it can be reopened or get partial quiz? I had most of it done.  &#34;If you have been doing extra credit so far and think you will have time for it at the end of the semester also, create token classes for also the commands: “RotateLeftArm”, “RotateRightArm”, “Define”, “Call”, “Thread”, “Wait”, “ProceedAll”, “Sleep”, “Undo”, and “Redo”. You will receive a little extra credit for these token classes in this assignment, and additional points later for features that depend on them&#34;      Should these classes extend our Word class just as the required classes for this assignment do?  I have completed the coding for Assignment 3, and it works how it should. However, I am receiving the following console output:      ### gradingTools.comp401f16.assignment3.testcases.MultipleNumberTokenOutputTest: 1.0 ### gradingTools.comp401f16.assignment3.testcases.MultipleNumberTokenOutputTest: 0.0 ### gradingTools.comp401f16.assignment3.testcases.MultipleQuoteTokenOutputTest: 1.0 ### gradingTools.comp401f16.assignment3.testcases.MultipleQuoteTokenOutputTest: 0.0 ### gradingTools.comp401f16.assignment3.testcases.MinusBeanTest: 1.0 No class matching: Minus ### gradingTools.comp401f16.assignment3.testcases.MultipleGroupingTokenOutputTest: 1.0 ### gradingTools.comp401f16.assignment3.testcases.MultipleGroupingTokenOutputTest: 0.0 ### gradingTools.comp401f16.assignment3.testcases.QuoteBeanTest: 1.0 Finding constructor matching:class java.lang.String Constructor not found:main.QuoteToken.&lt;init&gt;(java.lang.String) ### gradingTools.comp401f16.assignment3.testcases.PlusBeanTest: 1.0 No class matching: Plus ### gradingTools.comp401f16.assignment3.testcases.EndBeanTest: 1.0 Finding constructor matching:class java.lang.String Constructor not found:main.EndToken.&lt;init&gt;(java.lang.String) ### gradingTools.comp401f16.assignment3.testcases.StartBeanTest: 1.0 Finding constructor matching:class java.lang.String Constructor not found:main.StartToken.&lt;init&gt;(java.lang.String) ### gradingTools.comp401f16.assignment3.testcases.MultipleSignTokenOutputTest: 1.0 ### gradingTools.comp401f16.assignment3.testcases.MultipleSignTokenOutputTest: 0.0 ### gradingTools.comp401f16.assignment3.testcases.MultipleWordTokenOutputTest: 1.0 ### gradingTools.comp401f16.assignment3.testcases.MultipleWordTokenOutputTest: 0.0 ### gradingTools.comp401f16.assignment3.testcases.WordBeanTest: 1.0 Finding constructor matching:class java.lang.String Constructor not found:main.WordToken.&lt;init&gt;(java.lang.String) Property:Value expected value:arthur actual output:null ### gradingTools.comp401f16.assignment3.testcases.NumberBeanTest: 1.0 Finding constructor matching:class java.lang.String Constructor not found:main.NumberToken.&lt;init&gt;(java.lang.String) Property:Value expected value:45 actual output:null ### Assignment3Suite: 0.5833333333333334      I am not sure if this is of my own error (be it annotations or something else) or is a bug in the checker, but I am currently only receiving 45 of 90 points, though the program executes properly.\\xa0  Does anyone know when we typically receive graded assignments back?  I went to make my Bean class and called it stringScanner and realized it should be StringScanner so I saved as StringScanner and deleted stringScanner. \\xa0Now I get an error: \\xa0&#34;Class file collision: A resource exists with a different case: &#39;/Assignment2/bin/main/stringScanner.class&#39;.&#34; \\xa0But, stringScanner.class does not exist anymore so I can&#39;t figure out how to fix this error.

All I&#39;m seeing on my assignment 2 is yellow marks on small things like &#34;someBoolean==false&#34; instead of &#34;!someBoolean&#34;.

Remember you have to change the assignment name in the suite you use.      These are not complete and may give false positives or negatives. Do look at the console output for each test and see if it makes sense and let me know of any problems.      Hope they help      Prasun    Is assignment 3 ready for us to begin?  Class,      The package is:\\xa0lectures.interfaces   Quiz: Interfaces      The praxes are timed (based on TA times) so that a 1 hour 15-minute lecture is supplemented with a \\xa045 min-1 hour praxis, giving us about 40 minutes each week for class discussion. Of course, some of you will take more time than this,so you may need to work outside class to finish them.      To help you go faster, I have tried to reduce the width of text in the praxes so you can have the left half the screen devoted to Eclipse and the right half to Sakai.      The assignments after A1 are both much harder and easier than A1. They are easier as you do not have to define complex loops. All you have do is apply a &#34;formula&#34; covered in the lecture material through examples and explanations. They are much harder as you cannot simply use your knowledge of Java (and/or the web) and your wits to solve the problem. You have to know the material. This is why time spent\\xa0on the praxes/quizzes is a stitch in time and worth it, in my opinion.\\xa0      By default, Sakai does not publish feedback and I may forget to override default settings. So let know if that is the case. I just edited the constructors feedback settings.      Also, the quiz is due a week after the praxis is assigned in class - please be mindful of this.      Prasun  Will I still get partial credit?  Is it extra credit if we turn in the Assignments a day early? I&#39;m unable to submit it on Sakai, seems that the &#34;assignment 2&#34; part is replaced by &#34;recitation 3&#34; , can someone tell me what to do? the for loop within my scanString function parses numbers fine, but prints words and quoted strings infinitely,   ex.   1 2 3 4   prints   numbers: 1   numbers: 2   numbers: 3   numbers: 4   while\\xa0   &#34;word&#34;   prints   quoted string: word   quoted string: word   quoted string: word      quoted string: word   and so on.      is the problem in the how the loop itself operates or how the words/quotes are being parsed?  How many total classes will Assignment 2 have? I know it will have a Bean class. I&#39;m not sure if you wanted a Driver class for the main method?  Is MultipleQuoteOutputTest[20.0 pts] and MissingQuoteOutputTest[5.0 pts] on localchecks extra credit?  I&#39;ve tried putting the breakpoints in different positions and restarting eclipse but I still cant figure out why I cant step into / over anything, it either just goes ahead and prints everything or doesn&#39;t do anything at all.  if the string &#34;JJJ&#34; &#34;Sea World Gull&#34; is entered.   what output do you want?      word: JJJ   word: Sea World Gull      ------- or --------      word: JJJ   word: Sea   word: World   word: Gull     I understood and completed Part 1 perfectly fine, but I can&#39;t wrap my head around how the Bean class works.\\xa0Do we simply move the scanning methods\\xa0to the Bean class and use the Bean class to scan and print the input lines read by the main class?\\xa0Or do we incorporate the Bean class into the scanning method that remains in ScanningIterator?         (Different person): Also, what are the roles of each class? \\xa0Is the Bean class only supposed to get and set the ScannedString, or does it do more?  I have a quick question about how interfaces work as I am not sure I am understanding it correctly.       The use of an interface is to allow multiple classes to access methods from different classes?      Say you have class A and it has a lot of good methods that may need to be used again in other classes.      You also have to other classes called B and C that at some point may want to use methods from class A and you don&#39;t want to re-write the code so you can use an interface?      So you would say something along the lines of:      public class B implements A { \\t&#64;Override \\tpublic String methodOne() \\t\\t{ \\t\\t    //stuff \\t\\t} \\t \\t&#64;Override \\tpublic int methodTwo() \\t\\t{ \\t \\t    //stuff \\t\\t} }         Is this the correct way of thinking about interfaces?\\xa0 As a &#34;subclass&#34; of another class that allows it to use the other methods?  What does all of this mean?\\xa0 Are we supposed to know what all of this does now or is it just something we need to put down now and we will find out what it means later?   import util.annotations.Tags; import util.annotations.StructurePattern; import util.annotations.StructurePatternNames; import util.annotations.EditablePropertyNames; import util.annotations.PropertyNames;  &#64;Tags({&#34;Word&#34;}) &#64;StructurePattern(StructurePatternNames.BEAN_PATTERN) &#64;PropertyNames({&#34;Input&#34;,&#34;Value&#34;}) &#64;EditablePropertyNames({&#34;Input&#34;})     I only took screen shots of me using the breakpoints, and step into for debugging, and did not realise we needed to show step over and step return as well. Can I add screen shots to my assignment? Also I added a couple screen shots of my code itself but am not sure if that was necessary.  Class,      I have finally uploaded a version that is somewhat debugged. Aa always create a new configuration.      Prasun  Can I ask a not-so-relevant question?   Does Java pass values in methods&#39; arguments by reference or by value?   Here&#39;s what I learned by testing and searching online. Everything in Java is a &#34;pointer&#34; (or acts like a pointer, anyway) and thus passes by value. Is this correct? And if I want to pass by reference, what can I do?   By the way I used to code in C&#43;&#43; and am not very familiar with Java.   If I wanna get deeper in Java study, is there any recommendation on textbooks?   Thanks.  Whenever I click on one of the links to PDF&#39;s or Powerpoint&#39;s of the past two class lectures or any of the files on the course website, I get a 404 Not Found error.\\xa0 These links have worked for me the past couple of days.\\xa0 Any ideas on how to fix this?

After that those who have not submitted the scanning quiz should do so before the deadline      Prasun  Class,      I have uploaded a new version of assignment to make some clarifications/corrections based on the questions I have had today:      The links in the assignment were not working on one student&#39;s computer. \\xa0I recopied them and they work on mine.      Even though the scanner can be implemented without the suggested three methods, we do require them - you will lose style points if you do not implement them.      The order in which the three methods should be implemented has been given.      The term &#34;passing a string&#34; has been clarified.      Prasun        Since we&#39;ll be doing more praxes in the coming future, it is worth mentioning what you should try to get out of them. The hope with praxes is twofold: that by the time we discuss a concept, you have enough investment, questions, or background to learn it in a way that gives it context (since you have seen the concepts in code yourselves); and that you learn it in a hands-on and cooperation-oriented approach that makes it stick.      With that in mind, remember that a lack of certainty is a natural part of the process, and that you are not expected to master the concept from the praxis alone. When you come across a concept you are unsure about, experiment with the code, TALK to people around you, form hypotheses, write down and ask questions in the discussion that follows, and look into the detailed explanations of concepts given online. The idea is that once you do gain an understanding of a concept, it will be a more grounded one, spurred by experience and necessity.      So explore, be inquisitive, and don&#39;t be afraid to not know everything! Turn your uncertainty into a tool of learning by asking questions and experimenting.  Class,      Assignment 2 is up - I have not had a chance to proof it, so please point out mistakes you find as replies to this post.      I have also put a checks file, which may also have mistakes you should identtify.

Hello Everyone,   I am a former Student of Dr. Dewan that took 401 Fall of last year. I will be offering free tutoring for the class in room SN047 from 6-7:30PM on Monday and Wednesday. This hopefully gives you another avenue for help if you are unable to make other office hours. I am also available by email at\\xa0 sdgeorge&#64;email.unc.edu \\xa0if you would like to email me questions or let me know you intend to come to these hours. I am also flexible on evening hours if you have a time after 6 and day that works better for you. I will also be posting responses to try and help on piazza.      Note: These will start next Monday unless someone emails today  Are we writing one big public class to execute the instructions outlined in part one and then in part two, we&#39;re simply making a bean class that provides the material/properties for another class to modify to produce a desired output?  The instructions tell us to:   -Place and submit the screen captures in a folder -Not to put the screen captures in the project .zip file -Not to submit a second .zip file  However, I don&#39;t think we can actually upload &#34;folders&#34; to Sakai without zipping it to a single file first. What should we do?  I followed the instructions on the powerpoint ( http://www.cs.unc.edu/~dewan/comp401/current/Lectures/RuntimeLocalChecks.pdf) \\xa0but when I attempt to run the test, I receive an error message.

Is the link for the assignment 1 checks file on the website broken? It doesn&#39;t seem to be working for me.  Class,      Please make sure you have the JavaTeaching pulled and try and work as quickly as you can as we need both parts of the praxis, in the statics and instances subpackages, for assignment 2.      I have updated the import from git section to take care of the situation in which pull does not work. Just copy your changed files from the previous praxis to a folder (such as the desktop) in one click and reset and pull the project again. It is still possible you have problems, in which case you do need to reimport the project and set the class path.            ng\\xa0GitProject (JavaTeaching)        PowerPoint     PDF        I was skeptical at first, but this actually seems like a pretty neat tool. However, I&#39;m getting some issues. Whenever I run a check suite I pass the first test it attempts, but none of the subsequent tests. From the output it looks like it&#39;s correctly writing parameters to the console but only for the first several tests before it ends the program, starts it again, and passes the program nothing. Occasionally I&#39;ll get an error message, too. It looks like it stems from a NullPointerException occurring in the library. I&#39;m having some trouble reproducing it now.

However, earlier it  was  printing a stack trace. Still haven&#39;t been able to reproduce it.     Hi everyone,      This is a correction to the submission instructions that we (the TA&#39;s) gave during recitation.      The instructions for zipping your projects are still the same, and that zip file gets submitted as we had said. However, screenshots are NOT zipped together with the project. Instead, they are submitted as separate, additional files on Sakai.      Please do this from now on.      Thank you.  Class.      As \\xa0mentioned in the lecture, at least one of the answers to the latest quiz was wrong, which I have corrected.\\xa0      Also, I have changed the due dates of the Attendance and Discussion &#34;quizzes&#34; . See if you can submit multiple times to it.      Prasun  Class,      I need to take \\xa0extra steps to update it after I make changes to JavatTeaching.      I have just taken those steps - they seem to work, so in the resources sections, they should be available in the last column (under packages) as in:\\xa0    lectures.scanning\\xa0Package       I just noticed that the link from class dual roles is pointing to the wrong package. \\xa0Will try to fix it later.      PS: The following link contains all of the code:\\xa0 JavaToHTML       Prasun  If indexOf() and indexOfNot() are methods of ScanningIterator, their first argument, String s, is not needed since the input string is a member variable of ScanningIterator. The constructor of ScanningIterator initializes it. But the assignment asks indexOf() to have three arguments.\\xa0      Should we create ScanningIterator that implements Iterator&lt;Character&gt; rather than Iterator&lt;String&gt;?      If we indeed need to create ScanningIterator that implements Iterator&lt;String&gt;, I guess we should have a main class, say Scanning that implements Iterable&lt;Integer&gt;. So we assume a user gives a String array, each of which is like &#34;20\\xa0\\xa030 0100&#34;. Scanning takes the String array. We use ScanningIterator to process each of them and print out results on the console. Also the processInput() and scanString() don&#39;t need to be static.  is on the web:       lectures.class_dual_roles.statics\\xa0Package     lectures.class_dual_roles.instances\\xa0Package    \\xa0   remember to do statics before instances.  My Mac won&#39;t recognize the UNCChecks_6.5.0 file from the class website and whenever I try to access it, Eclipse tells me the file isn&#39;t available. I&#39;ve tried moving it to locations other than the plugins and dropins but it gives me the same error message. Does anyone have advice or suggestions?            Many of you thought it was due at midnight, so I have given you a few more days to finish it in case you do not see this message today.  Class,      First,\\xa0when I said &#34;private&#34; is banned and will make sense when we study inheritance, I really meant &#34;protected&#34;. I did have some exercises involving private, but I have removed them as there is no quiz question on it, and this praxis is enough work without it. If you played around with private - that is great.      Based on all of the issues I saw, I have modified the praxes to help you answer the questions more directly. Before or right after each exercise, I have put the relevant question as some of you had difficulty seeing the connections. Make sure no comment is collapsed - I believe the comment on imports was in some cases.      If you have been able to answer the questions with the original praxes and web searches, good. Otherwise pull or reset and pull again before tuesday ideally.      As the assignment is due tomorrow, many of you were more concerned about the assignment rather than the praxis for the next assignment. I am not sure how to handle that, will discuss in class.      The web links have also been updated, but some of text in the comments is mangled in the translation.\\xa0      You are expected to get all of the quiz questions in discussions involving your partners and us. So if something is not apparent from the praxis, please let me let us \\xa0know immediately - the three of us were idle much of the class time. Do not feel shy!      Prasun        Class,      LocalChecks calls your main multiple times, once for each input it tests. So if you call System.exit(), the local checks UI will terminate after the first test, and you will not see the output.      In later assignments, the TAs&#39; grader will also call some of your methods directly. So if you call System.exit() the entire grading session for all students will terminate.      So please do not call System.exit() in your programs, just call return.      If you have already submitted the program, do not worry, our grading of A1 will not be affected. But if your localchecks window is not giving you the test output, this is the reason.      Prasun              i successfully installed Local checks on my computer. However, every time I try to run it, the program will freeze without giving me any output. What should I do to make the program to work?  When I ran Local Checks, I always got &#34;correct output but errors&#34;. What does that mean?\\xa0  What is Invalid Character Suite in Local Checks? Do we have to pass it to get the whole assignment correct \\xa0( without doing extra credit Error Recovery)? Cuz it seems that the computer&#39;s input contains letters which are assumed not to be in user input.\\xa0  In the Assignment 2 document, it says to add:   import util.annotations.EditablePropertyNames; import util.annotations.PropertyNames; import util.annotations.StructurePattern; import util.annotations.StructurePatternNames; import util.annotations.Tags;   But for each of these I get: \\xa0&#34;The import util cannot be resolved&#34; from eclipse      EDIT: \\xa0I thought I had associated oeall22.jar with the project but I had apparently not. \\xa0This fixed it.  Class,      Based on two incorrect projects I have seen, here are some mistakes you might have made. Except for 1 and 6, you will get more points if you correct them with a late submission.  I will add to this list if I see more problems.       1. Comparing the entire line with &#34;.&#34; using equals() (which I did not mention in the assignment), instead of comparing \\xa0the first character with &#39;.&#39;.      2. Parsing the terminating line into an integer , thereby throwing an exception.      3. Continuing to ask for input even after the terminating line has been recognized and not parsed.      4. Not implementing your indexOf() function.      5. Using\\xa0the \\xa0banned predefined indexOf() function of String.      6. Printing the number (200) rather than the token (0200)      Also,\\xa0to make localchecks work, you should execute “ new Scanner(System.in)” once. This means it should be executed outside the input reading loop. You will not lose points for not meeting this requirement, but you may want to change your code and run localchecks\\xa0to catch errors.        Class,      Visit class page:\\xa0 http://www.cs.unc.edu/~dewan/comp401/current/ \\xa0and overview it.      Install Java, Eclipse, and read the tutorial on Git and pull JavaTeaching (Importing\\xa0GitProject (JavaTeaching) )       If you are not in the correct recitation please contact:\\xa0Jodie Gregoritsch &lt;jogregor&#64;cs.unc.edu&gt;      If you are unsure about having enough background, start the first assignment asap and see if you know how to do it. Go to the section on Scanning.      If you do not know Java, look at the section on Relevant Java\\xa0Syntax. You will face some teething problems, which you should overcome in a couple of weeks.      I will post today&#39;s lecture as soon as the video is made.      Prasun              Is on the web (Also I edited my previous post a bit to identify the git section)  after downloading the eclipse installer from the website I am faced with a bunch of different options to install. I assume they are all different from each other in small ways but which tool do we need for this class? I&#39;m thinking its the first option, but I want to ask to make sure...   Where can I find the instructions on completing the first coding assignment?\\xa0 Is it posted yet?         Thank You  Is there a specific name that is needed for the first assignment?  Class,      We have updated the slides for JavaTeaching to\\xa0address these errors. See slides 10-14.      Prasun        I followed all of the instructions on Checkstyle PDF twice (the second time on a clean Eclipse install) but I don&#39;t seem to be getting the option to use the UNC Checkstyle configuration.    After completing the process both times, all I have access to are the default Google and Sun Checkstyle configs. Any ideas what I should do?  I&#39;m having trouble getting the CheckStyle software to work. It says &#39;no software site found&#39;. Anyone know what&#39;s going on?         Are we permitted to use Arraylists on this first assignment? Specifically for the scanString() method we have to implement.        I tried to download the jar files ObjectEditor and Checkstyle. After finishing downloading, I tried to open them and it said that they could not be launched. I have the latest versions of Java downloaded. What should I do?  Are we to assume that the user will only enter in numbers as potential tokens? If so, why is using the Character.isDigit() function necessary?  Class,      Look at the following for today&#39;s in-class activities. We will have some teething problems with software installation - maybe those of you who successfully downloaded can help the others. Only half the original class has enrolled in Piazza s far, not sure what that implies, but am worried ...           Lecture Structure        PowerPoint     PDF        I have a completed working version of Assignment 1 and I get a checkstyle violation for importing java.util.scanner (illegalTypeImported: (Assignment1.java:2) Used disallowed class java.util.Scanner). \\xa0In the assignment document it says we are expected to use Scanner.nextLine(). \\xa0Should I disregard this violation?     Did anyone else encounter this problem when trying to extract the eclipse files you downloaded?         Are we allowed to use StringTokenizer to break up the string?\\xa0 Or should we use parsing?  Class,      I have uploaded \\xa0new version of\\xa0UNCChecks_6.5.0.jar .      if you have successfully installed checkstyle, \\xa0close eclipse and overwrite the \\xa0previous version of this file with the new version and then restart Eclipse. Also look carefully at slides: 19-37. A lot has changed, so this is really important.      if you have not successfully installed checkstyle, look at the whole slide deck.\\xa0      Semion has confirmed that Checkstyle installs correctly Neon on Windows.      The pdf of slides of course are in:\\xa0 http://www.cs.unc.edu/~dewan/comp401/current/Lectures/UNCCheckStyle.pdf       Checkstyle is not essential to doing your project so do not spend too much on the installation and use of it. But if it installs quickly it is probably useful for some.      In the next recitation, we might go through itsinstallation.      Prasun  Is it necessary that we create an indexOfNot() method if we can accomplish the variable spaces extra credit without it? Since indexOf() function will give us the position of spaces/numbers, next step is to get number by components, are we allowed to use string slice in this process?  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sloved, thanks! I am ready to submit my assignment 1 and I just wanted to make sure I was submitting it correctly. \\xa0The assignment document said not to include the screenshots in the .zip archive so I am uploading 3 files - Assignment1.zip, which contains the entire project directory, as well as one screenshot showing basic functionality and one showing extra credit functionality. \\xa0Is this the right way to do it?  Piazza is a Q&A platform designed to get you great answers from classmates and instructors fast. We've put together this list of tips you might find handy as you get started:  1.   Ask questions!   The best way to get answers is to ask questions! Ask questions on Piazza rather than emailing your teaching staff so everyone can benefit from the response (and so you can get answers from classmates who are up as late as you are).  2.   Edit questions and answers wiki-style.   Think of Piazza as a Q&A wiki for your class. Every question has just a single  students' answer  that students can edit collectively (and a single  instructors’ answer  for instructors).  3.   Add a followup to comment or ask further questions.   To comment on or ask further questions about a post, start a  followup discussion . Mark it resolved when the issue has been addressed, and add any relevant information back into the Q&A above.  4.   Go anonymous.   Shy? No problem. You can always opt to post or edit anonymously.  5.   Tag your posts.   It's far more convenient to find all posts about your Homework 3 or Midterm 1 when the posts are tagged. Type a “#” before a key word to tag. Click a blue tag in a post or the question feed to filter for all posts that share that tag.  6.   Format code and equations.   Adding a code snippet? Click the  pre  or  tt  button in the question editor to add pre-formatted or inline teletype text.  Mathematical equation? Click the  Fx  button to access the LaTeX editor to build a nicely formatted equation.  7.   View and download class details and resources.   Click the  Course Page  button in your top bar to access the class syllabus, staff contact information, office hours details, and course resources—all in one place!   Contact the Piazza Team anytime with questions or comments at  team@piazza.com . We love feedback!\", \" Any code style regrade requests should be in by tomorrow (Wednesday, 12/6) night.

I&#39;m a computer science graduate student working with KMP here at UNC. I&#39;m working on\\xa0a project funded by Google to study the effectiveness of computer science undergraduate\\xa0learning assistants in an attempt to improve the way we teach courses like COMP 401.   \\xa0   Today in class, I&#39;m going to speak for a few minutes about the project and what it means for you all.\\xa0At that time, I&#39;m going to ask you to complete a quick online consent form. Although\\xa0I will explain this in more detail during class, the form essentially authorizes the use of some class-related data for researching ways to improve\\xa0COMP 401 in future semesters.   \\xa0   Online consent form link (wait for class before following this link):\\xa0 https://unc.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cRXWN7lVZGIYVOR      \\xa0\\xa0   A major goal of the project is to design effective tools that can be used to improve COMP 401. One of these tools is the\\xa0 ASCEND \\xa0 Eclipse plugin, which we will be using to provide virtual office hours; another is\\xa0 My Digital Hand , an online waiting list and management system for in-person office hours. Since we haven&#39;t discussed\\xa0 My Digital Hand \\xa0yet, I&#39;ll spend a few minutes in class talking about the tool. We will be using\\xa0 My Digital Hand \\xa0 for managing\\xa0 all \\xa0in-person office hours.      Here are two guides for getting started with  My Digital Hand :       How to Create your My Digital Hand Account        How to Use My Digital Hand to Get Help at Office Hours    \\xa0   #pin    Please read this post before going to get help at office hours!\\xa0This post is intended to\\xa0answer any\\xa0questions you have about office hours and help you get the most out of this valuable resource.   \\xa0    What are office hours?    \\xa0   Office hours are your\\xa0opportunity to get one-on-one help from experienced tutors\\xa0with your COMP 401 assignments, study material, code, or anything else related to the class. Office hours are a valuable resource provided by the department; take advantage of them!   \\xa0    Who provides help at\\xa0office hours?    \\xa0   Instruction is offered during office hours by KMP, the graduate teaching assistants (TAs), and the undergraduate learning assistants (LAs).   \\xa0    How do I receive help at office hours?    \\xa0   To get help at office hours, it is imperative\\xa0that you complete the following procedure:    Go to the location\\xa0where office hours are being held.  Log in to\\xa0  My Digital Hand  \\xa0on your smartphone or computer.  On\\xa0 My Digital Hand , submit\\xa0the help request form. To submit the form, you will be required to specify the\\xa0question you have. This information\\xa0will be forwarded to the instructors\\xa0currently on duty. You will be added to a queue\\xa0of waiting students.  Once it is your turn, an instructor\\xa0will accept your request;\\xa0 My Digital Hand \\xa0will update to show that you&#39;re being helped. At this time, the instructor will find you and try to answer your question.  When the instructor has finished giving you assistance, you will be able to resubmit the &#34;interaction request form&#34; as\\xa0necessary to request more help.       Also see the  My Digital Hand \\xa0 guides explaining\\xa0 how to sign up \\xa0and\\xa0 how to get help at office hours .   \\xa0    What is\\xa0 My Digital Hand ?    \\xa0     My Digital Hand  \\xa0is a tool developed here at UNC\\xa0to help manage office hours. The tool is a virtual queue of students waiting for help, but it also encourages a structure for office hours that reduces waiting times and increases effectiveness.\\xa0Students\\xa0will need to\\xa0 create a\\xa0 My Digital Hand \\xa0account \\xa0before being able to receive help at office hours. We will be using\\xa0 My Digital Hand \\xa0at all office hour sessions.   \\xa0    What types of questions are appropriate for\\xa0office hours?    \\xa0   A wide range of\\xa0course-related questions are valid for office hours. Questions about course material, test questions, assignments, bugs in your code, etc. are all a good fit. Remember that you can always ask questions here on Piazza as well, especially if you think they could be useful to\\xa0other students. Avoid questions like &#34;How do I start the assignment?&#34; Instead, try to show that you spent some time thinking about the problem before phrasing\\xa0your question.   \\xa0    Is it okay to come to office hours to work on my assignment?    \\xa0   Students often\\xa0like to work on their assignments during office hours. While this is OK, remember that assignments are still individual work. It&#39;s okay to ask your LAs for help when you get stuck (that&#39;s what they&#39;re there for), but it&#39;s not fair to ask your LA to walk you through every step of the\\xa0assignment. Out of respect for your LAs and for other waiting students, please try to wait until you actually have a well-defined question before requesting help from an LA.   \\xa0    When are office hours?    \\xa0   See &#64;59 for the office hour calendar.   \\xa0   Keep in mind that as LA\\xa0availabilities change, it&#39;s possible that office hour sessions may be canceled, cut short, or rescheduled. If you&#39;re looking to attend office hours, keep an eye out on Piazza for last-minute changes to the office hour schedule.   \\xa0    Where are office hours?    \\xa0   KMP holds office hours in his office: FB 154      Graduate TAs hold office hours in their offices.

I was 1% off the next grade and I&#39;m absolutely sure my extra credit works, but my grade is still the next letter down.  Are we going to get the grade we received on the final? or is our final grade just going to be inputted?    Hey everyone! Since we all just finished the exam we&#39;re obviously in the coding mindset, so go register for PearlHacks!      The event is Feb 9-11th. If you weren&#39;t in class when I talked about it, Pearl Hacks in an all-female hackathon. So, if you identify as female, you can register to participate! It&#39;s a totally free weekend, tons of sponsors come out and give away free stuff (I got a Google blanket and water bottle last year), and the prizes are actually really nice (last year drones and VR systems were given away). Not to mention free food is provided the entire weekend (last year we had places like Bandidos and Med Deli catering, we don&#39;t cheap out on food). If you don&#39;t identify as female, you can still register to volunteer. Hackathons look great on resumés and are a super fun way to spend the time between the Duke game and NC State game :)       pearlhacks.com          I believe I&#39;ve either completed processing all punchlist items including A8 regrades or have contacted you directly by email if additional clarification or actions was necessary.  I didn&#39;t see anything about Widgets on any practice exam or KMP&#39;s review.\\xa0 Will we need to know anything about them (like how to write them)?  Nevermind I understand it now        I understand everything about this part except for the last line:   So you have the people_in_range List, but in the ArrayList methods given in the problem the method is:           E[] e_array = alist.toArray(new E[alist.size()]);            My question is why is the argument passed in to .toArray()   &#34; new Person[0] &#34;      and not   &#34; \\xa0new Person[people_in_range.size()] &#34; as the given example above?   Does this have something to do with how the .toArray() method works? Or am i missing something with the logic? Any help appreciated  From the Spring 2014 Final:       Casting a reference to an object from a subclass type to a parent class type is an example of  cotravariance .       Does this question mean mean\\xa0 covariance \\xa0or\\xa0 contravariance ? I&#39;m not aware of the term &#34;cotravariance&#34;.      Thanks!      Edit: The answer being\\xa0False makes me think it meant contravariance, but I&#39;m not positive.  Would it be OK if memory_size was a field inherited by all from Phone and the constructor for DumbPhone doesn&#39;t take memory_size as a parameter but when calling super() sets it to 1? Because right now all classes have a memory_size but in the example answer the field isn&#39;t created until the very last subclasses.   Is there anyway that could backfire?      Screen_Shot_20171211_at_2.53.35_PM.png       It makes sense for method overloading, but if a method is overridden than this should be false.  Will Swing or AWT appear on the final? They&#39;re not in the practice exam questions and\\xa0final review slides.  Can anyone explain why the class person is written as abstract and not a regular class?  Will there be any partial credit awarded for any of the questions that require more than one answer?  Will there be scantrons provided (for free or not) tmw??  I think this question might be similar to the &#34;speak&#34; method in the other final (&#64;942), but why is it wrong to say   abstract public Status getStatus();   in the Person class? You could then define the enums and the methods in the subclasses.  In review slides, KMP said an Object is immutable if it is private and\\xa0has no setter. He also said immutable means that it cannot be changed after being created. But the private&amp;no setter object can still be changed by another instance of the same class. Is it contradictory? Should we ignore this case?  Assignments submitted after now may not be considered for late credit. Will depend on when I retrieve grades from the autograder for the last time but technically last day for credit was last Friday anyway.  anyone know when the last day to submit assignments (late) is?  So what is delegation? Could someone explain it a little bit? THANKS!\\xa0             An iterator can be passed to a method as a parameter. this is true.\\xa0How to pass it though?\\xa0           Are office hours still a thing right now or are all the TAs too busy with exams? Have the points from the punch list form been added to our participation grades yet? Would it be acceptable to put the speak method in both the Dog class and the Siamese class rather than as an abstract method in the Pet class?\\xa0 Is it just better practice to throw exceptions for those that don&#39;t have the method rather than\\xa0trying to separate who does and doesn&#39;t have it?\\xa0\\xa0  Why\\xa0is this the solution for part 4 in the 2014 Fall Final? I thought you couldn&#39;t have abstract\\xa0methods\\xa0inside a non-abstract class? Should Pet class be abstract?      Does anyone remember there was a website for midterm review? I think it was helpful but I can&#39;t find it..\\xa0:(\\xa0     So there&#39;s already a question on here somewhere asking why this is ok in the Fall 2014 Final Part II (c)   InterB ib2 = (InterA) ((B) c1);   and I completely understand why it&#39;s fine.\\xa0 My question is, why is this, which is basically the same thing on the Spring 2014 Final,  illegal ?   InterB ib2 = (InterB) ((C) e1);   Since Java is virtual, you still need to check whether an\\xa0E object can be cast as a C object (which it can in this example), but then you would go back to the E object to check if it can be cast as an InterB, right?\\xa0 Which it can be, so it would be legal? The logic for the two is the exact same, but one is legal and another is not.\\xa0 may I ask why?      Also (I just noticed this),\\xa0in the first one, why is it stored as an InterB object?\\xa0 Does that have anything to do with why one&#39;s legal and another&#39;s not?     Could someone explain the below and break down how you get the answers?\\xa0 I was able to do lines 3 &amp; 4 but 5, 6, 7 are a bit confusing. I do know that i&#39;m calling the version of bar with type Foo in line 5, and passing in the value of f2 (which is 12) but I&#39;m not sure what f.b is calling in that method.\\xa0 I think if someone could explain that I should be able to work the rest of it out.      Thanks in advance!      a) Given the following definition of class Foo:  public class Foo { public static int a = 8; public int b;  public Foo(int c) { b = c; }  public void bar() { if (b &lt; a) {   b = a*3; } else {   a = b*2; }   }  public void bar(Foo f) { if (b &lt; f.b) {  b = f.b * 2; } else {   f.b = a &#43; b;     }   } }   Fill in the table to the right, providing the value of the expressions f1.b, f2.b, and Foo.a after each of the lines 3 through 7 of the following code snippet is executed   (note, line numbers provided for reference and are NOT part of the code).   1: Foo f1 = new Foo(7);   2: Foo f2 = new Foo(12);   3: f1.bar();   4: f2.bar();   5: f1.bar(f2);   6: f2.bar(f1);   7: f2.bar();           Line #      f1.b      f2.b      Foo.a        3      \\xa0      \\xa0      \\xa0        4      \\xa0      \\xa0      \\xa0        5      \\xa0      \\xa0      \\xa0        6      \\xa0      \\xa0      \\xa0        7      \\xa0      \\xa0      \\xa0          I have a gradescope account, and it shows my work from comp110 last year, but it does not show anything from this year&#39;s midterm. I tried adding the course with the code 401001 so I could see my midterm, but it would not accept that entry code. Any ideas on how to help?  I have a 10.0 of style grading in gradescope. But in the autograder, the STYLE part is not graded. Anyone else has the same problem here? Should I be concerned?         I recall KMP saying in class that this diagram is incorrect, and that Model is actually the Observable and Controller shoud be labelled as Observer. Can anybody else confirm this?  If our assignment grade is higher than 100, will that be the grade that is used to calculate our final grade, or are assignment grades capped at 100?  Can anyone explain why the length of the array is the maxvalue &#43; 1?                      How come fields and methods with no access modifier, meaning package access, are not accessible to subclasses if subclasses are in the same package as their parent class?      If I&#39;ve understood correctly, one reason to make fields private and use getters/setters is that you may want that field to be read-only, meaning you&#39;d only provide a getter and no setter. For example:   public class ExampleObj(){   private AnotherObj field;   public ExampleObj(){     field = new AnotherObj();   }   public AnotherObj getField(){     return field;   } }   Now if you were to retrieve that field in another class using the getter like this:   ExampleObj obj = new ExampleObj(); AnotherObj a_variable = obj.getField();   Would &#34;a_variable&#34; not be referencing the same place in memory as &#34;field&#34; from the original class? Meaning if you were to do this...   a_variable = some_new_object_of_type_anotherobj;   ...why wouldn&#39;t the value of &#34;field&#34; also change to that new value?       EDIT: Nevermind. I think I understand where I went wrong in my logic.   I created a video series for Model View Controller. This video should help clear up some confusion about MVC.   There&#39;s is a quiz to check your understanding before and after the videos.    The goal of the tutorial is that your model view controller understanding and quiz score will improve.      1.

Fill in the table to the right, providing the value of the expressions f1.x, f1.y, f2.x, and f2.y after each of the lines 3 through 7 of the following code snippet is executed (note, line numbers provided for reference and are NOT part of the code).            1: Foo f1 = new Foo(1);   2: Foo f2 = new Foo(2);    3: f1.bar(3);   4: f2.bar(4);    5: f1.bar(f2.bar(5));    6: f2.bar(f1);  7: f1.bar(new Foo(6));                                    Can someone explain midtern Part II parts c and d?  This is marked true in the multiple choice section of the 2014 final:      &#34;  A Java source file can only contain one public class or interface.&#34;         Can someone explain how this is true? We have almost all public classes and interfaces in our assignments and they are all in the same SRC folder.     Does anyone have the correct implementation of the MakeHand method from the last part of the midterm?  In regards to the last part of this years midterm, why does the constructor for HandImpl have to be marked protected when in our notes i thought it said factory constructors are private?  Could someone explain how style grading is factored into the final grade? Unfortunately, the syllabus makes no direct reference to style.  I just checked my grade and found that I pretty much have a zero for a8, even though I think I implemented all of the classes correctly. Is there any way I can come in and talk to KMP or a TA or an LA about this?  Hi, does anyone know what is the score of FramePuzzle based on? Mine works fine but got 3 points took off. If there&#39;s still chance to improve it I&#39;ll definitely do it. Thanks!!  The comments on my assignment say that FramePuzzler &#34;starts out randomized&#34; and some points are taken off, was it not supposed to? I thought the whole point is that the picture is scrambled and you have to solve it like a puzzle by moving the white square around. Is that wrong?  Style grades including all regrade requests that came in before I turned regrade requests off have been updated and integrated with the other assignments on the autograder.     A8 grades have been posted.     So given these interfaces and classes -\\xa0      public interface InterA extends InterB {...}   public interface InterB {...}   public interface InterC extends InterA, InterD {...}   public interface InterD {...}   public class A implements InterA {...}   public class B implements InterB {...}   public class C extends B implements InterC {...}   public class D extends B implements InterD {...}   public class E extends D implements InterA {...}      A a1 = new A();   B b1 = new B();   C c1 = new C();   D d1 = new D();   E e1 = new E();         How\\xa0is this cast legal? A B object\\xa0doesn&#39;t\\xa0have an is-A relationship with\\xa0InterA.   InterB ib2 = (InterA) ((B) c1);\\xa0    Are blue and green swapped for setPixel and the text on the label? I thought the usual order was red, green, blue. Thanks! Review slides posted where lecture slides usually are.  Must we complete the entire extra credit assignment to be considered eligible for any points? Or can i do for example 1 out of 3 features or 2 out of 3 features and still get some points but not all?  Hi, I&#39;m a little confused about the implementation of the copy\\xa0pixel function. Specifically I don&#39;t know how should the pixel inspector tool and the paint brush tool interact with each other. I&#39;m currently considering two\\xa0solutions, one is to use ImageEditorController as a middle place and let the two tools communicate through the controller, and the other is to add\\xa0one of the tool to the other tool&#39;s constructor so these tools can communicate with each other independent to other elements. Which one is a better design? (or if neither is, what would be a better way?) Thanks!!   I blend the pixel at the image preview with the pixel of the picture but it only blends when clicked. If I drag around too much it causes it to only print the solid preview color. thoughts? Did KMP say at the end of last class that we would not have to write out code for user interface components and like model view controller stuff?  In the constructor of the view, can you take in the controller as a parameter and store that in a field? Or does the interaction between the controller and the view have to be through listeners and events?  Right now I have a 5/10 on the style grade, and I&#39;m curious what weight that will have in my final grade. It wasn&#39;t given a weight in assignment 1 so I don&#39;t know how to factor it in. Also, if a 7/10 is a 100, is a 5/10 a ~75?\\xa0  Could someone say me that how can get my grade style grade, Please?\\xa0 Where this appears?     Code style regrade requests should be made through gradescope and not via the punchlist form. If you previously requested a code style regrade request through the punchlist, be sure to do so via Gradescope as well.  Just wondering if you can upload the slides from today &#64;KMP  Does anyone know where to find the grade scale for this class (specifically, what grade corresponds to an A, B, C, D, failing grade, etc.)? It&#39;s not on the syllabus or anywhere else I&#39;ve checked...  Does anyone have any ideas on implementation methods for the undo function? I&#39;ve tried a few things and nothing is working particularly well.  I am not going to be able to make office hours tonight from 6-7pm. Ill be hanging out in the office from 12-2 if anyone has any questions.\\xa0  Does anyone know where we can find what topics we will be tested on for the final exam?     Has anything been decided about when the make up exam for the final will be?  Hey guys,      When is the last call for style regrades? I haven&#39;t had anything regraded yet, so I&#39;m not really sure how to do it, and I&#39;m definitely not sure of the final deadline.      Any help would be appreciated.  Are there any more practice final exams? (I see two on KMP&#39;s index of practice ones)      Additionally, is there an online resource of the answers to our midterm? I remember we went over it in recitation but was not sure if it was uploaded online.  Do we have class tomorrow? Wasn&#39;t sure because Thursday&#39;s lecture made it seem as if we had finished learning the material.  I&#39;m not gonna be able to make today&#39;s 3:30 - 4:30 office hours due to an interview. I will hold extra hours either tomorrow afternoon or wednesday afternoon.     So for A8, if we turned in a version with some minor errors on Friday, then turned in a completely working version afterwards, if the version with the errors gets a higher score because of the &#43;5 points, would that be used for our grade instead of the one submitted afterwards? Or would only the most recently submitted one be graded?  Does anyone have advice on how to update the xoffset and yoffset of a piece after you move it? My pieces are not updating to the xoffset and yoffset of the new location, where the blank piece was. Is there a simple method I could use to fix this?  Can someone give me some hints on how to implement mouseclicked and keypressed\\xa0methods? For keypressed method, I wrote a case for each arrow key. I did use getPicture but didn&#39;t use setPicture to do the swap. That&#39;s probably where the problem came from. For mouseclicked\\xa0method, I created a double for loop to find the row or column that contains the white tile but I don&#39;t think I&#39;m the right track.\\xa0  My FramePuzzle is working. However to use it by clicking it takes an extremely long time for a piece to move. The keyboard works instantly but not when I click with the mousepad. Does anyone know what could cause this?  can we still submit regrade requests? i have done all that was stated that i need to change in the code style comments but i can&#39;t find a way to submit a regrade request    Should we only code for one click that is to start the puzzle, and then we solve to puzzle and just use the keys, or should we be able to make several clicks and it still be solvable?  I added a keyListener to both the panel and each individual picture view that i added. \\xa0I also have print statements that run when I press any key, and when i press up, down, left, right. \\xa0However, when I run my program and push any key, nothing happens. I don&#39;t know if I added my KeyListeners correctly  My current syntax for switching the pictures is that I&#39;m taking the switching the subpicture locations using the = sign, Are we supposed to use the setpicture method on the pictureview array?  My Keyboard works perfectly and I can use my clicker after it; however, when I use my clicker first, my keyboard doesn&#39;t want to work after performing clicks. Does anybody have suggestions on how to fix this? Thank you!  So I think I&#39;m getting close, I have a &#39;blank&#39; square in the bottom right and I can control it with the keypad. If I click all the way over to the left side for example and then back to the right it will take pictures from the top row of the picture? Sometimes I will get duplicates of one &#39;mini picture&#39; in the 5x5. Does anyone know what could be causing this?  Is it required that we have the tick marks labeled on our image adjuster like KMP does? Will this be factored into our grade?\\xa0  So, for the most part, the blur method works. However, it only works when the other sliders alongside the blur are moved.\\xa0 When the blur slider is moved by itself the result can&#39;t be seen until one of the other sliders are also moved. Does anyone know what is going on or how to fix the problem?         *Nevermind I figured it out I forgot to add ChangeListener to the blur slider.  I&#39;m really struggling on how to get the pictures in the FramePuzzle to shift when i click on one in order to swap it with the blank picture. I have them all in the array. I just can&#39;t seem to get the code to work. Any help would be much appreciated.\\xa0  Hi everyone, I have been struggling with the blur method for quite a while. I&#39;m looping through the cloned picture and then looping again at the size of the amount blurred. Then averaging using the pixeltoRGB helper method (also didn&#39;t work when I just averaged all the red green and blue values). Then setting the pixel to this new averaged pixel. All I get when I run it is the picture\\xa0turns black and then nothing happens. Any advice please?? (also nothing really changes when I take out the if amount &gt; 0).\\xa0      if (amount &gt; 0) { \\t\\tfor (int y = 0; y &lt; pic.getHeight(); y&#43;&#43;) { \\t\\t\\tfor (int x = 0; x &lt; pic.getWidth(); x&#43;&#43;) { \\t\\t\\t\\tfor (int s = 0; s &lt; amount*2; s&#43;&#43;) { \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfor (int h = 0; h &lt; amount*2; h&#43;&#43;) { \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsum &#43;= helper.pixelToRGB(pic.getPixel(s, h)); \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tb&#43;&#43;; \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t} \\t\\t\\t\\t}  \\t\\t\\t\\tavg = sum/b; \\t\\t\\t\\tPixel f = helper.rgbToPixel((int)avg); \\t\\t\\t\\tpic.setPixel(x, y, f); \\t\\t\\t\\tsum = 0; \\t\\t\\t} \\t\\t} \\t\\t}     I figured out how to stop the flashing/flickering when a PictureView is updated. Unlike my last &#34;solution&#34; which only made the flashing tolerable, this solution eliminates\\xa0it. It solved a major issue I&#39;ve been having in Assignment 09, the flashing is insufferable on an 1920x1080 image, and I wish I had used it in Assignment 08. Oh well.      Add this method to PictureView:      &#64;Override public void update(Graphics g) { \\tthis.paint(g); }      That&#39;s it. No more flashing.      The default implementation of update fills the canvas with the background color before painting. That&#39;s unnecessary in this case, and since the background color default is white filling the canvas with the background color makes the whole PictureView flash.      Depending on how you set up your project you still may have flickering from a different source, but this got rid of all the flashing for myself.  I&#39;m struggling with setting up the\\xa05x5 grid of PictureView objects. I created a double for loop that creates a picture at each grid (I also created a 2d\\xa0array for this). I know I didn&#39;t do it correctly because I ran into a &#34;null pointer exception.&#34; Some other posts suggested to try\\xa0out the tile iterator from A6 but I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m supposed to use that class or just apply the same logic. Please help me!  My mouse listener is working fine, but I can&#39;t get any response when typing a key. Here is what I have thus far and I have added the picture view array elements directly into my widget if that is a problem (no extract panels or anything).\\xa0      For some reason when I move any slider the sky changes to green and the sand changes to pink in KMP&#39;s picture. Has anyone else had this issue? My sliders actually work fine aside from this.  If we plan to add comments to a8, do we also need to add them to the main methods or is leaving comments in the Widget classes alone just fine?  I submitted my A8 on Thursday because I thought it was complete and then found a tiny bug today and just resubmitted it. Will the graders automatically choose the most recent submission to grade?  Hi,\\xa0      So I store the PictureView objects in a 5x5 double array. But,\\xa0   I&#39;m having trouble understanding how to get the array index of a PictureView object. I retrieve the X and Y\\xa0 pixel\\xa0 values when I click but I don&#39;t know how to return the array index easily from like e.getSource(). Does anyone know how to find out which cell in the array grid you&#39;ve clicked on?\\xa0  For my stateChanged method in my ImageAdjusterWidget I have nested for loops that go through each pixel in the picture known as p\\xa0and change each pixel to the averages it&#39;s supposed to be. The problem is when my code gets to p.getPixel(i, j), I get an error that says the x (which is i) is out of bounds and it says it&#39;s because x&lt;0 or x &gt;= width. Please help.    If we didn&#39;t get it right the first time, will we have a chance to resubmit the assignment? Mine is turned in and correct as far as I can tell but I have no way of knowing since there isn&#39;t a grade yet.  So, everything was working beautifully until I tried clicking first\\xa0 and then  using the arrows. When I do this, the arrows do not work but when I use the arrows and then click it is fine. Does anyone know why this would be?  My frame puzzle works except for the fact that the blank tile&#39;s image changes to that of the first tile it&#39;s swapped with. That&#39;s the only time it changes though. Anybody else have this happen/know how to fix it?         *Nevermind I got it  first row and sometimes part of the second row is not displaying when program is first executed, as shown in image below. as soon as i click or press keyboard, however, the row appears as it should. i&#39;ve tried adding this.revalidate() and this.repaint to the constructor and they don&#39;t make a difference.      is this a serious problem that will lose me points? or perhaps a hardware/graphics bug that is out of my control? i have no idea why it is happening, and sometimes it doesn&#39;t happen at all.      i&#39;m using my TileIterator class from A6, if that might be part of the issue. i would appreciate it if a TA or LA could let me know about the severity of this issue.         Hi Everyone,   I am just wondering if these are the correct outputs for A8 FramePuzzle Left and Right movement. Thanks!!!              So I&#39;ve figured out how to slide the tiles such that they slide away from the clicked tile and the clicked tile becomes blank, but the original blank won&#39;t seem to change.\\xa0 Anyone have any ideas why this might be?  Should the blur\\xa0slider average pixels only left, right, above, and below whatever pixel is about to get replaced, or should it also average the pixels diagonally touching said pixel?  My arrow keys and mouse work separately. However, if I use the arrow keys at all then start trying to click I end up creating a bunch of blank pictures. Anyone else encounter this problem? and how did you address it?     When I click super fast, like trying to manipulate the picture really quickly, it freezes. As long as you wait a tiny bit of time (actually small, way less than a second) between clicks it works, but if you do it too fast nothing happens. Will this be penalized?  Hi Everyone,\\xa0   I have a really unfortunate problem. Only my picture_view KeyListener has been able to change the frames of my picture. My main_frame KeyListener is able to print out my test print statements (so that its KeyPressed method is being called). However, even though it has the same KeyPressed method as my picture_view KeyListener object, it not able to change the frames of my picture. Thank you all for your help, and I look forward to hearing from you!!!  So first off I assume we are uploading A8 to the autograder even tho it will be manually graded, correct?      Second, if I were to upload what I have at the moment today before midnight, would I still be able to turn in other updated submissions before Sunday night? Or will the TA&#39;s only choose one submission to grade for each person?      Hope that makes sense sorry if this was already asked/answered  For the ImageAdjusterWidget class, is it necessary to create new implementations of the A8Helper methods that you need to use within the class? I am confused because since JPanel is already extended as a parent class, you cannot extend the A8Helper class and cannot use methods such as pixelToRGB() without including the A8Helper class.  Should our FramePuzzelWidget have just a 5x5 GridLayout? \\xa0I am having a hard time adding mouselisteners and key listeners. Is it okay if my blur method runs extremely slow? Or should I find some way to optimize it? like it takes ~7 seconds to go from blur 4 to 5,. Should we be randomizing the puzzle pieces initially? Some of the TAs thought it shouldn&#39;t be initially randomized but it was unclear if this was the case or not.  It works just fine and in any order you move the sliders. However, it&#39;s very slow since it goes through all three slide methods anytime something changes. Will points be taken off for program speed?  Is it better to split the original picture into multiple picture panels and move them within the main frame, or should we be changing the entire picture each time? I&#39;ve tried to just change the whole picture each time but it takes my code way too long to run(as in it takes over five minutes without responding).  Does anyone have any suggestions for how I can go about splitting the Picture into a 5*5 grid of picture view objects?        I made a 5x5 grid of PictureView objects, but when I add MouseListeners to them and run the program, I get this error:      Exception in thread &#34;AWT-EventQueue-0&#34; java.lang.ClassCastException: a8.PictureView cannot be cast to javax.swing.JPanel      I tried adding each PictureView to a corresponding JPanel, but then the MouseListener only functions when I click in the borders around the PictureViews  Will there be another grade for style if we received a passing grade the first time?  Does anyone know how to actually update the JPanel after the\\xa0tiles have moved?\\xa0 My blank tile is actually moving positions in my array, but I still can&#39;t see that change on my picture, so I believe my update method is at fault.\\xa0 Thanks!  Should there be a different method for each change event for the blur, saturation and brightness in Image Adjuster? if so, how do we get the three to be connected?  Hi Everyone,   Sorry for all the questions. Thank you Rachel for the KeyCode advice. I was able to get it to work. However, I have one small dilemma. My KeyPressed method does not work unless I do a MouseClick first. Does anyone have any advice for this problem? Thanks!!!  Will we need to create a class variable for the blank tile or is there another way to locate where the solid pixel is at any given time within the FramePuzzle?    Hi Everyone,   I am confused about how to distinguish between buttons for the KeyListener part of FramePuzzle. Are there symbols for up, down, left, and right or do I just say (if KeyEvent e == &#39;up&#39;) etc. Thanks!!!  Can somebody explain how I should go about moving the white picture in frame puzzle? I have it set up but I&#39;m having a hard time translating the concept of tracking the white picture into code. I used a gridlayout(5,5) of jpanels that have subpictures. I know I need to figure out where the mouse click was and switch the adjacent subpicture with the white picture. How do I make this switch and keep track of it&#39;s new location if I assigned each subpictures original location using a 2d array?\\xa0      Sorry if this doesn&#39;t make sense but I&#39;m confused. Thanks!!  everybody do your part to make KMP the hottest professor at UNC         Is A8 for sure being style graded or\\xa0is our code going to graded solely based off of functionality?  Hey guys,      My blur method is running really slowly; in fact, it&#39;s so slow, that it won&#39;t run on an image much larger than 100x120.      The only solution I have for blur involves this secondary set of for loops inside of my other set of for loops:   for(int y=0; y&lt;pic.getHeight(); y&#43;&#43;) { \\tfor(int x=0; x&lt;pic.getWidth(); x&#43;&#43;) { \\t\\tPixel pi=pic.getPixel(x,y); \\t\\tif(Math.abs(ctr-x)&lt;=factor &amp;&amp; Math.abs(i-y)&lt;=factor) { \\t\\t\\tcounter&#43;&#43;; \\t\\t\\tredAccumulator&#43;=pi.getRed(); \\t\\t\\tgreenAccumulator&#43;=pi.getGreen(); \\t\\t\\tblueAccumulator&#43;=pi.getBlue();  \\t\\t} \\t} }   This code is horribly bulky and slow. Now, I know that there&#39;s some way to iterate only through the pixels that I need to care about, but I&#39;m at a loss as to how to do that. Any help would be appreciated.      I have tried a solution involving an ArrayList of pixels surrounding a given pixel and using their values to alter the pixel in the center, but, for some reason, when this loops throughout the picture, it creates a white box on a black field that increases and decreases in size with the slider. I know that this white block represents the area that must be taken into account when blurring, but I&#39;m not sure why it doesn&#39;t iterate across the entire picture.  I added 25 Picture Views to my GridLayout(5, 5) but when I added a MouseListener for each PictureView, in MouseClicked(), how do I determine if the click is within a region that is in the same row or column as the solid picture view? \\xa0  So when I move my saturation slider up, the black pixels aren&#39;t handled correctly. It gives me this at saturation 100. But I have a catch in my code for black pixels,\\xa0      if (pix.getIntensity() == 0.0) {  newPix = new ColorPixel(0.0,0.0,0.0);      and it sets that as the new pixel. Anyone know why it&#39;s doing this?        If I submit a8 early will the bonus credit cover style grading? I really don’t want to comment.\\xa0 My blur and saturation both work, but moving the brighten slider doesn&#39;t change any of the pixels unless at -100 (goes to all black) or 100 (goes to all white). I used the lighten and darken methods from a4 jedi, has anyone else had this issue or have any ideas?  Does anyone else feel like the formulas given on the assignment description aren&#39;t working? \\xa0I feel like my brightness method isn&#39;t making the pixels brighter its just adding a white tint to the picture, and same with the darkening, just with a black tint. \\xa0I used the blend lighten and darken methods from Assignment 4.  I&#39;m having a little trouble understanding what exactly opacity is - the assignment says it is &#34;a\\xa0percentage between 0 and 100 which controls the blending of the paint brush color and the existing color of the pixels being painted.&#34;\\xa0    So, for example, would that mean if opacity was 60%, you blend together the paintbrush&#39;s R/G/B\\xa0at 60%, and the existing color&#39;s R/G/B weighted at 40%?  I know that &#64;796 attempted to solve this question, but I am still curious as to how to fix this issue. Once I click in my program once it&#39;s able to do what the arrow keys ask just fine.      I set focus/request focus both in my constructor and\\xa0all 5\\xa0pictureViews, so I&#39;m not sure what else to do.  So someone may have already asked this type of question before, but I&#39;ve got my sliders working for the most part, like when i move the blur slider forward from 0--&gt;3 it blurs the picture but when i try to move the slider from 3--&gt;0 it blurs it more instead of de-blurring it. Is my problem have to do more with the blurring code or does it have to do with using a picture vesus a obervable picture or something else. If so, what should i do to fix it?\\xa0  Need the sliders work backwards, too?      For example, after setting the blur slider to 5, should setting the slider back to zero cause the PictureView to revert to the original image?      Aside: When I set my blur to 5, I get the following result. The pixels it&#39;s getting to blur are from a new, separate picture,   and I&#39;ve double checked my averaging equation. It seems wrong to be that white. Any tips?      I had everything working for ImageAdjuster, but then I checked changing the brightness after changing the other sliders. When I do this, nothing\\xa0changes. However, if I adjust brightness first, then everything works correctly together. Does anyone know why this might be happening?    My jar file is failing to create when i try to export my assignment 8, does anyone know why this happens?  It appears the entire cs.unc.edu site is down for me. Anyone else experiencing the same problem?  What object do I need to add a keylistener to in order to implement the key movements for FramePuzzle?   Thanks!  Hi Everyone,   So I created a new 5 x 5 GridLayout, but I am confused about how to divide the original picture into 25 different chunks. Do I need to create a method that does this or should I individually create the 25 pictures?  Hey y&#39;all, when my blur factor is greater than 0 my picture becomes slightly more purple than it was before. The change is so slight that it almost seems like it could be normal. Anybody else know why this might occur and if it is even noticeable enough to matter? Thanks!         What will be the last day of office hours?  Hi Everyone,   All of my ImageAdjuster components work, but my picture takes like 20-25 seconds to recognize each slider change. I don&#39;t know if there is a way to fix this without changing my code, but if there is I would gladly like to know. Thanks!!!  Anyone working on assignment 9 has any idea how to copy a value from one tool to another? I managed to save the Pixel color in PixelInspector but cannot send it to the PaintBrush.  For any Saturation between 1 and 100, my picture has a couple spots that just turn completely white, is this\\xa0normal?   In order to change the values of each JLabel displaying the X coordinate, Y coordinate, etc., does anything else need to be done other than calling the repaint or setPicture methods? Is it necessary to create a list of ChangeListeners and attach each component?  So I have everything set up in ImageAdjuster (i.e. the sliders and labels are all there). I also have the sliders &#34;connected&#34; to the picture, such as, if i write a double for loop to replace all the pixels in the image to white when i move the blur slider, it works. So my question is, is there anyone that can point me in the right direction in actually writing the code to blur the pixels. Like i understand what it is asking me to do, I just don&#39;t know how to implement it.\\xa0  In my stateChanged method in ImageAdjustorWidget, I have the line of code,\\xa0      _picture_view = new PictureView(output);      where output is an observable picture that I have called the blur, brighten and saturate methods on. \\xa0However, the picture in the program when it runs stays the exact same, even if i change output to null. \\xa0So is there some other method I need to put the new picture up? repaint() or something?     I feel like I&#39;m missing something obvious, but is there a way to save the values returned from the helper method pixeltoRGB(Pixel p) individually? So that if I run it on Pixel p I can save the red, green, and blue values separately from each other.  Does anyone has A8 graded? I submitted several days ago and it&#39;s still ungraded  Should we be using the observable and be adding ROIObservers for Assignment 8?  I&#39;m stuck on how to find the row/column of the clicked pixel to see whether or not it is in the same row or column as the blank square. I realized you cannot just obtain the x and y values of each click because it is not the x and y of the entire picture, just the smaller picture that i created when i divided it up. If anyone knows how to fix this that would be great.  Just wondering about the policy on editing KMP&#39;s code to help execute our programs - not sure if there is any expectation regarding this. Are we expected to only create new classes, or can we also expand on the stuff provided?      For example, is it alright to add a getter for the PictureView object to KMP&#39;s SimplePictureViewWidget (A8)? It seems like a small edit to me, and helps me out. Just wondering.  After fixing some errors I was getting, I felt like I had set up the blur slider correctly on my ImageAdjusterWidget. I must still be doing something wrong, because now when I try to move the slider the program just freezes completely (no blurring) and I have to close it with the stop button in eclipse. Has anyone else experienced this?  Should the changes be smooth when moving the slider for blur, brightness, and saturation or should the changes occur after the slider is done moving?  Whenever I use the slider to adjust the picture, the picture just turns white, any idea why it might be doing that?  Okay, so, I&#39;m not sure how to solve this issue. In regards to adjusting the brightness, I seem to be changing the original picture  and  my changed_picture field; somehow, both are pointing at the same object... I think. I have what I think is a field referencing the original picture. I have a picture that I&#39;m changing. I don&#39;t know why, but, for some reason, I seem to be changing the brightness for both my &#34;original picture&#34; and my &#34;changed picture&#34;. It literally doesn&#39;t matter which one I add to the panel.      TL;DR - How am I supposed to maintain an image of the original state of the picture in memory while simultaneously altering an essentially identical set of pixels according to the slider? How am I supposed to get around altering the original image?      I am able to adjust the brightness, but it completely sticks, making the image darker and darker or brighter and brighter until it only switches between black and white.      There&#39;s another poster (A8 Brightness Dilemma) that seems to be experiencing the same thing, and that post has yet to be answered. Any help would be appreciated.  I am currently holding extra office hours from now until 12:30  how do we know what day the final is? Is it posted somewhere?  I&#39;m extending the A8 deadline to Sunday night, but there will be a 5 point extra credit for getting done by the original due date (Friday night). Also, Friday&#39;s recitation will be used as open office hours (still in FB009).     So in an attempt to average pixels according to the assignment instructions, I somehow have ended up with this blur solution...\\xa0   Has anyone else ended up with\\xa0this? Is this most likely an issue with the way I am averaging the pixels? I am using the RGBToPixel and pixelToRGB methods from the helper, should I be doing something different?            Will there be practice exams provided for the final similar to those provided for the midterm?  I can&#39;t get the picture frame to refresh after I click to move the blank space. I tried swapping the pieces by using the remove\\xa0and add methods but they just add the pieces back to the original spot as if nothing happened.  Hi Fellow COMP 401 Students,   Has anyone else had this problem? I am thinking about just creating a conditional that could round any pixels above 1.0 to 1.0. But I don&#39;t think that is the way to go. I don&#39;t know why this is happening because I copied the formula correctly. Thanks!!!        I&#39;m still confused how to make the filters work cumulatively. I use the original picture as a parameter when calling my saturate, brighten and blur methods in the widget and then edit copies in the method so that each individual filter works but I cannot figure out how to keep one filter in place when using another. I&#39;ve tried making fields for the slider values to store and then send as parameters but that did not work.\\xa0I guess I&#39;m just asking if anyone has tips on where to use copies vs. just the original if that&#39;s the key to the cumulative aspect. Thanks!\\xa0  Is it okay if the blur method rounds the slider value up to get the size of the surrounding pixels that you&#39;re averaging? So if the slider is between .5 and 1 it will average each pixel with the pixels within 1 unit of its x and y values.\\xa0  I have written my code for the KeyListener section of FramePuzzle, and everything is working as it should, with one caveat.      In order for the program to accept any key commands, I first have to click inside of the JPanel containing all of my PictureView objects. The program will then switch pieces as intended, but I have to click inside of the JPanel again to trigger another KeyEvent.      Has anybody run into a similar issue?  Can anyone tell me if the blue method should be a void method, or return a picture?\\xa0 I&#39;m also having issues setting my rgb values since I can&#39;t call the ColorPixel setPixel method.\\xa0 I currently have an array I&#39;m (trying) to loop through to set the new values.\\xa0 Am I approaching this wrong with an array?  In the ImageAdjustorWidget, when we implement the sliders in the constructor should they call the method, addChangeListener() ? and if they do what should the parameters be? \\xa0I tried just having it be &#39;this&#39; but it doesn&#39;t seem to be working. \\xa0Should we set the parameter as this.stateChanged() ? Thanks  While a picture&#39;s repainted the picture appears to flash white since there&#39;s nothing displayed in the instant the repainting occurs. Is this acceptable? Or do I need to repaint the picture in such a way that no flashing occurs? It&#39;s very quick, but it&#39;s there.      EDIT: In my Frame Puzzle I was swapping PictureViews in my JPanel. Instead\\xa0I should&#39;ve been using PictureView.setPicture(ObservablePicture). This paints fast enough that the flashing is gone entirely. I had been using this method in my ImageAdjust implementation, however, and there&#39;s still flashing there. I think with a large enough picture their may always be some flashing. Depends on the implementation I suppose.  Should the pieces of the puzzle be mixed up when launching the program?  Hey class! I am going to switch the 3pm office hour today to Friday at 1pm and will definitely extend the hours if necessary. Sorry if it causes any inconvenience!  The instructions for the blur method say that it &#34;Replaces each pixel as the average of the pixels around it.&#34; Is the pixel we&#39;re changing averaged into that, or no? I.e. if we had a white pixel surrounded by black pixels, would the blurred pixel be black or grey?     Hi everyone,   Does someone have the FileTest for the assignment#8?How can I notice where I have the errors? Please give me an idea about that because I do not know why the auto grader did not turn my grade back, so I can not find what is the errors? Thank you.  Hi Everyone,   I am having a dilemma with my brightness slider. In my ImageAdjusterWidget, I created a second picture which takes in the picture passed in as a parameter. Then I use that second picture in my change brightness method. However, rather than remaining constant, the values of my second picture (getRed, getGreen, getBlue) are also changing as the picture passed in as a parameter gets darker. As a result, because my getRed, getGreen, and getBlue values are continually decreasing, my picture only gets darker even when I &#34;decrease&#34; the darkness with my slider. Does anyone have any advice for how to keep the getRed(), getGreen(), and getBlue() values to remain constant at the values of the picture passed in as a parameter (that has not been darkened or lightened)? Thank you!!!\\xa0  I&#39;m not feeling well today so I won&#39;t be able to make my 3:30 office hours today. If I&#39;m feeling better by tomorrow morning, I will hold extra office hours tomorrow starting at 10am going to 12:30pm. Sorry for any inconvenience.\\xa0  Hi Everyone,   Sorry but I am still pretty confused about blur.      Here is what I think I understand: The blur method takes in a blur value (1-5) and then finds the average red, green, and blue value for all pixels within that area (If the blur value is 2, then the blur method determines the average red, green, and blue value for all pixels within two x coordinates or two y coordinates of the given pixel). Then all the pixels within that area (two x or two y coordinates) are assigned the new pixel value (the determined average red, green, and blue values).\\xa0      Here is what I do not understand: I do not understand how this method could make any significant changes to the picture since the picture has more than 600 y values and 400 x values and the blur method only changes pixels within 5 x coordinates or 5 y coordinates of the given pixel.      Sorry for such a long post. I will be grateful for any advice!!!  Can we still submit a regrade request for style? \\xa0I know a lot of them were done before Thanksgiving but I&#39;m hoping we can still submit a regrade request as I&#39;ve spent a lot of time redoing A6 and A7 in the past few days.        My office hours this week need to be moved in order to accommodate various other meetings. They will be (for this up coming week only):      Monday 2 - 4 pm   Wednesday 1 - 3 pm     How do decide brightness given the number between -100 to 100? Are there any formulas?  I received an email\\xa0informing me that my style grade had been updated, however when I clicked the link it said that it was ungraded. It says - / 10. Does anybody know what this means?\\xa0  Hi Everyone,   I am stumped on how to change the KMP in Namibia Picture. I tried setting a newly created picture for PictureView picture_view, but the picture did not change. I even tried creating a new picture view with the newly created picture and placing this new picture view in the spot of the old picture view in border layout. Could someone advise me on what I am doing wrong? Thanks!!!  Hi Everyone,\\xa0   Sorry for all of the earlier question. I was able to figure out MouseListener. I just have a quick question. What is the significance of the 1-5 blur values when the blur value is just the average red, green, and blue values?  Does my ImageAdjusterWidget have to implement both MouseListener and ChangeListener or just MouseListener? Also, I tried to call image_adjusterwidget.addChangeListener() in my main, but it said that this was an invalid method call even though my ImageAdjusterWidget class implements both ChangeListener and MouseListener. Does anyone have any advice for me? Thanks!!!  So the way you blur is you take the average of the surrounding pixels. However, because of this there would be 9 possible cases (4 corners plus 4 edges plus middle) as each of these cases need to average a different set of pixels. For example a pixel on the very left edge would not average any pixels left of it because there are no pixels there.      Is it okay if our edges stay deblurred?\\xa0Or would we have to account for the 9 possible scenarios?\\xa0Also, is there a better way of doing this besides just creating 9 if statements?\\xa0    For some reason when I use the slider for my image, it changes the picture accordingly but won&#39;t go back to the original picture when I return the sliders to 0. (In general, it won&#39;t &#34;de-blur&#34; or &#34;de-saturate&#34; at all. Does anyone know how to fix this?      EDIT:\\xa0 If anyone figures this out please share!  I am trying to test my sliders but I keep running into an error that reads:      Exception in thread &#34;main&#34; java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: adding a window to a container   at java.awt.Container.checkNotAWindow(Container.java:490)   at java.awt.Container.addImpl(Container.java:1091)   at javax.swing.JLayeredPane.addImpl(JLayeredPane.java:231)   at java.awt.Container.add(Container.java:973)   at javax.swing.JRootPane.setContentPane(JRootPane.java:626)   at javax.swing.JFrame.setContentPane(JFrame.java:698)   at a8.ImageAdjuster.main(ImageAdjuster.java:16)      My line 16 reads:      main_frame.setContentPane(image_widget);      Could anyone help me out?      UPDATE: i figured it out  Hi Everyone,   I added a MouseListener to each of my sliders, but I am still struggling to think of how I can notify my widget that the value of one of my sliders is changed or is changing? Any advice would be appreciated!!! Thanks!!!   (I tried to call blur_slider.setValueIsAdjusting(true) in my mouseClicked method, but true was an illegal parameter, I also tried to compare slider.getValueIsAdjusting with slider.setValue(), but that did not work either).\\xa0  Hi Everyone,   Is adding a Change Listener the same as adding a MouseListener? Because I tried to add a MouseListener to each of my sliders, but then I got stuck from there? I added a MouseListener because ImageAdjuster_Widget implements a MouseListener and not a ChangeListener, so which one should I implement? Also, I saw another Piazza post saying they called the blur, saturate, and brighten methods in change listener. So is change listener an object, a method, or both? I called blur, saturate, and brighten in my mouseClicked method (however, I haven&#39;t gotten it to work yet). Thanks for the help, and hope everyone had a good Thanksgiving!!!  Hey Everyone,   So I created a second panel for my x, y, red, green, blue, and brightness components, but I am having a little trouble thinking about how to add each of these elements to my second panel. Does anyone have any advice that might point me in the right direction? Thanks!  Hi Everybody,   Has anybody else had this type of error when trying to set the values of their x, y, red, green, blue, and brightness fields? I tried to set all of them at the same time in my mouseClicked method, but as a result of those actions, I got this error. Thank you for reading this post, and I am grateful for all of ya&#39;ll&#39;s help!!!         I&#39;m having trouble getting the Pixel Inspector to update since a mouselistener is attached to the observable picture already, but if I&#39;m not changing the source picture, then the widget can&#39;t seem to update properly. The only thing that changes in response to a mouse click is all the JLabel fields, but I don&#39;t know how to make them into listeners since I&#39;m not sure how to reference the mouse clicks.\\xa0  Will we need to be using multiple threads for assignment 8? \\xa0My code seems to be very slow and I am wondering if that is because I am not using multiple threads.  Taking off for Thanksgiving. Happy Thanksgiving!  Does each type of panel: PixelInspector, ImageAdjuster, and FramePuzzle require its own Widget or should they all be able to operate with the SimplePictureView widget?  I will not be holding office hours this Friday.  Came in a too late, anyone know if there was a quiz today?  Hi Ya&#39;ll,   Sorry I hate to be that guy, but have CodeStyle Regrades been completed? I put in a request and am still waiting on my regrade, but from a few posts, it looks like many people already received their regrade. I&#39;m just wondering because Piazza says that the regrades will hopefully be done by Thanksgiving break. I am ok with getting my regrade back at a later time, but I was just wondering if I am not the only one still waiting. Thanks!  Does the panel that displays the info of the clicked pixel have to appear immediately when you run the app, or is it okay if it doesn&#39;t show up until the user clicks?      Could someone help me figure out how to give more space to the sliders (i.e. get rid of all the white space in between them and their labels)?      I currently have the 3 labels and 3 sliders in a 3x2 GridLayout panel. I&#39;ve tried putting both the labels and sliders into two separate panels within the larger SOUTH panel, but I get the same result in the end.\\xa0  What exactly is the algorithm for changing the brightness of a pixel? I tried averaging the current pixel with black/white pixel based on the brightness adjustment value (divided by 100 from slider) so that if if the slider was at -25, any given pixel would\\xa0have 75% of the color value and 25% of the black pixel value. This doesn&#39;t really work.   Any ideas?  For the blur, saturation, and brightness Methods, are we supposed to be changing the pixels of the picture in the picture view? or do we create a new picture to set as the output?  Calvin, Megan, and I will not be having office hours tomorrow (5-7)pm. The university is closed and so are we. Even if the university is not closed, and I was wrong, we will still not be there, so don&#39;t show up. Enjoy your break.  Hey class, I am not able to hold office this afternoon. I will definitely make it up after the break!      Rachel  Hi everyone,\\xa0      I won&#39;t be able to make it to my afternoon office hours today. I will make them up tomorrow afternoon, sorry for any inconvenience.  For the Blur part, it says to average pixels around each pixel. Are we supposed to just average out the intensity of each pixel, or average the value of blue, red, green of each pixel?   Also, in KMP&#39;s solution, the maximum for blur is 5, are we supposed to set it 5 as well or we are supposed to make it as big as possible? (I would think the biggest would be the width &amp; height minus 1) Hey guys sorry for the late notice, I caught the freshman plague and feeling under the weather and won&#39;t make it to my oh tonight I received the same grade on my regrade as I did on my original and I am slightly confused. Some of the reasoning behind the responses do not match with what is in my code. Is there a way that I can meet with whoever graded my code style and receive a detailed explanation?      Thanks.\\xa0  Are we allowed to request a regrade up until Monday of this week?\\xa0   Also, are we allowed to submit our code style version of a6 and a7 even after their original due date to receive the grade style points?        Hey guys,      I know that we can use a different picture, but can our assignment also look different otherwise? For instance, in regards to the first widget, can the summary be split between two different panels for aesthetic reasons?  My blur, saturate, and brightness sliders all work separately, but I cannot make them cumulative. I am not sure how I can make it cumulative. Whenever I try to continuously edit one version of the picture, it cannot be reverted back to the original picture when all sliders are set to 0. What picture are we supposed to setting the pixels and which version of the picture are we supposed to be getting the pixels from? If anybody has any advice I&#39;d greatly appreciate it!  So, I&#39;m successfully retrieving the X and Y values when clicking on the image, but I&#39;m having a hard time figuring out how to retrieve the colors and brightness.\\xa0 I&#39;m not seeing anything I could call with e. to retrieve those values or what other class I could use, I can&#39;t use e.ColorPixel.getRed()....  My office hours will not start until 3:30 PM today as I will be attending an additional recitation.  For today&#39;s recitation, you&#39;ll be asked to write up your answers to some questions about the exercise. Please turn those in via Sakai. There should already be a Sakai assignment titled &#34;11/17 Recitation Writeup&#34; open for submission.  In the instructions for saturation, it reads:      &#34;Let b be the brightness (i.e. intensity) of the original pixel.&#34;   \\xa0   Does this mean the  original original  (AKA from the picture object in the constructor) or is this the original from the most recent change?\\xa0  I&#39;m having trouble figuring out how to add labels to my sliders. Can anyone figure out what I&#39;m doing wrong?     blur_slider.add(new JLabel(&#34;Blur: &#34;)); slider_panel.add(blur_slider); add(slider_panel, BorderLayout.SOUTH);     For ImageAdjuster, I&#39;ve gotten as far as\\xa0adding sliders and ChangeListeners to go with each one, and each ChangeListener calls the appropriate method (blur, saturate, brighten). In each of these methods, I iterate through all of the pixels held in the picture object passed to my constructor and change them using setPixel. After I finish altering the picture, how do I get the widget displaying my picture to show my updated one?  Too sick to make it to class today, but could someone let me know if there was a quiz today and post a link if there was?  I will be asking the TAs to begin code style regrading soon (hopefully done before Thanksgiving break). They will be primarily looking at your A7 and A6 submissions. If you need a style regrade (i.e., you have less than 7 out of 10 points now), please indicate that by submitting a regrade request via GradeScope.     For ImageAdjuster do we need to implement ChangeListeners for the Sliders? If so, how should I go about starting that?  Do we need to create 3 new classes and 3 new main methods for each part in assignment 8?  I have been working on Assignment 8 and have found that in certain situations, it would be useful to have Pixel methods from previous assignments, such as brighten(), darken(), and blend(). Is there any reason why we wouldn&#39;t be able to add methods to the Pixel interface and its implementations?  How do I request a regrade on gradescope? I submitted a6 with all the issues fixed but I forgot to request a regrade for that assignment. Will TA&#39;s automatically regrade for a7 or do I have to submit a request?  In assignment 8, it says that we can do one or more of the widgets. Will we get full credit if we only do one, even though all of the points add up to 30? I&#39;m having a little trouble figuring out how to print multiple lines of text within a JLabel. I have been able to print out one String successfully, but once I add more the newest String replaces the others. I also tried using the JTextArea component, which didn&#39;t even print out to the JPanel. Does anyone know what I&#39;m doing wrong or have any suggestions for what to try? Thanks I won&#39;t be able to make may 3:30 - 4:30 office hours today. I&#39;ll make them up next Monday most likely.  In his write-up, KMP says the following:       “The class A8SetupTest is a simple test application that creates a Picture object from a URL using the A8Helper.readFromURL() method, creates a new top-level user interface window with a SimplePictureViewWidget to display the Picture object along with a title.        If your setup is working correctly, you should be able to run A8SetupTest and see me appear on the screen along with the caption &#34;KMP in Namibia&#34;. Mouse clicks on the image should print coordinates of the click to the console. If all is well, it will look like this:”       Are we supposed to edit the set-up class to handle click events? It says &#34; If your setup is working correctly &#34;, but I&#39;m confused as to what that means. When I run A8Setup nothing happens. Is he saying that once we write PixelInspector we can test it with A8Setup?       Edit: I deleted the package, restored it, and it worked. Computers are weird.   Assignment 8 has been posted. The due date has been adjusted to be the Wed. after Thanksgiving Break. I plan on releasing A9 before the end of the week also.  I need the morning to work on a NSF proposal that is due at midday, so I&#39;m moving my office hours to 3 pm.     Hi Everyone,   I got a bad grade on the first Code Style evaluation and was just wondering if anyone knows when Code Style grades will be reevaluated. Thanks!  I have been absent from a couple of recitations, but have completed the majority of recitation quizzes and in class reading quizzes, but the participation points in my page on the autograder shows absolutely nothing complete. Have these not been integrated at all or is there some problem with mine??  I&#39;m failing all of these. My hit counts are correct, but when it calls the hit.get(top, bottom, left, right) method my code fails after the first or second one. I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s wrong with it, especially since it&#39;s recording the right number of hits.      EDIT - the tro.reset function doesn&#39;t seem to be working in my code, which is causing the region stored in hit to be different. It&#39;s one of KMP&#39;s methods so I&#39;m not entirely sure what to do.  The autograder should be back up. I&#39;ll adjust the due date to midnight tonight to give people who weren&#39;t able to submit while it was down a chance to do so without having it marked late. A8 will come out later today and we&#39;ll talk about it in class tomorrow.  When will assignment 8 be posted ?  I know there is already a question about this &#64;671 but I\\xa0understand the test code and still don&#39;t really follow the solution posted there.\\xa0      op.suspendObservable();   op.setPixel(a, pix);   op.setPixel(b, pix);         //c is a coordinate with x = 4, y = 6 and is the   //only coordinate in an ROI of tro   op.setPixel(c, pix); \\xa0   op.setPixel(d, pix); \\xa0\\xa0   op.resumeObservable();   assertEquals(1, tro.getHitCount());      RegionHit hit = tro.getHits()[0];\\xa0      // expected 4, was 2 \\xa0** my code fails here!!   assertEquals(4, hit.getTop());      // expected 6, was 8\\xa0   assertEquals(6, hit.getRight());      //these two run correctly when I comment out the first two   assertEquals(6, hit.getBottom());   assertEquals(4, hit.getLeft());   tro.reset();      Since c is the only\\xa0coordinate in a region that is being observed, my code correctly notified the observer only once when resume was called (so it passed the first assertEquals call). The getHits()[0] should return the changed region passed to the\\xa0notify method, because KMP&#39;s test code then adds it to an array of RegionHit objects. So, am I giving\\xa0the wrong changed region when I call notify? I feel like i would have a lot more issues if that were the case. it seems that the x coordinate is right on for the upperLeft and the y coordinate is right for the lowerRight. Any ideas?      edit: resolved, needed to notify observers with their specific intersecting region of change instead of the whole thing.\\xa0    I&#39;m cancelling office hours this week (Mon and Wed) due to family issue (baby delivery). Sorry for the inconvenience. This is the code I have for unregister observer:   \\tfor (DecoratedObserver x:observers) { \\t\\t\\tif(!(x.getObserver().equals(observer))) { \\t\\t\\t\\tnew_observers.add(x); \\t\\t\\t} \\t\\t} \\t\\tobservers=new_observers;\\t \\t\\tnew_observers.clear();   can anyone see why it&#39;s failing?\\xa0  Currently, I am storing just one ROIObserver and one Region in my container class, but I&#39;m not able to pass the oneObserverManyRegions test this way. Should I be storing an arrayList of Regions for each observer in my container class instead?  Hey Guys I&#39;m sorry my cat got really sick and I have to take him to an emergency vet visit and wont be able to make it to office hours tonight. Ill make them up Wednesday at 8am.  Could anyone give me some advice on how to create the changed_region that the observer will be notified of when it is resumed. So far in my setPixel method, I create a new region using the coordinate passed into setPixel. Then I &#34;union&#34; the newly created pixel with itself. My question is how to add all of these newly setPixel regions together. I was thought to maybe create a &#34;counter&#34; region. So I created a new region (counter_region) and set it to null in my constructor. Finally, hoping to continually build a larger region, I said that if observable is suspended, then unioned_region.union(counter_region). I then stored these values in an array list, and notified my observer of the last array list value (&#34;presumably the biggest&#34;). However, my suspend and resume methods are still incorrect. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!!!  Hi Everyone,   Sorry for yet another question, but I am just super confused about what is wrong with my suspend and resume methods. From what I understand, my suspend and resume methods are supposed to regulate whether or not my observer is notified in setPixel, and then my setPixel method is only supposed to notify if the region of my observer intersects with the region of the setPixel. I believe that my methods are doing these things, yet my suspend and resume methods are still wrong : ( Am I missing something? Thank you for reading my long post, and any advice would be appreciated!!!   P.S I am not entirely sure what the notify method is supposed to do, but from what I think an LA was trying to tell me, my notify method in my decorator class simply calls the notify method of the ROIObserver interface. In short, I am pretty confused, and am in need of some advice. Thanks!!!  When I log in autograder, nothing appears and I cannot see the website and submit my assignment.     Hi everyone? Excuse me, last night I was working third shift, so did not know what was happen for the due date for assignment 7. I am worry since could not finish up the assignment 7. Could you let me know? as I am seeing it on the assignment dates it is the same, but there is some hope that says on Monday. Can not understand what is going on?   \\xa0  Hi Everyone,   So I am having a really weird problem. When my setPixel method calls notify via my RIOObserver interface such as c.getROIObserver.notify(Picture p, Region r), my suspend and resume methods do not work, but everything else in my code works. However, when my setPixel method calls notify on my decorator class Container such as c.notify(Picture p, Region r), my entire code for Part 2 is wrong. Does anybody have any advice for why this may be the case because I am stumped : ( . Any advice will help. Thanks!   P.S, my Container class has getROIObserver(), getRegion(), and notify() methods Title Hi Everyone,   I am confused about how to resumeObservable() after suspending it. I was thinking it might be a good idea to switch observable back on and then call setPixel to get back into the loop, but I could not think of how to get the Coordinate and pixel parameters to do so. Then I tried to call the notify method in my resume method, but that did not result in any changes either. Does anyone have any advice on how I might be approaching this problem incorrectly? Thanks!!!  I cannot log into the autograder to submit A7\\xa0  My unregisterROIObservers method works just fine but for some reason my\\xa0unregisterROIObserver method (which is essentially the same) is giving me this error:      java.lang.AssertionError: expected: &lt;1&gt; but was: &lt;0&gt;      The\\xa0main difference between the two methods is in the first, I use the given region to test for intersection with my region list (I opted for making two parallel lists instead of a decorator class):      regions.get(i).intersect(r);      In the second method I use the given observer to test for equality with my observer list:      observer.equals(observers.get(i));      Should I be using this equals function?\\xa0   \\xa0\\xa0  Could someone who did well on style on the last assignment post an example?

Help?  Hi Everyone,   If you did not know already, I am super confused. Does my decorator for ROIObserver need to have a getRegion() method or not? If it does not, how am I supposed to check if my ROIObserver intersects with a given region? Thank you for any help you can offer!!!

Oh and disregard the System.out.println statement, forgot to delete it before i took a screenshot.  Hello! Sorry to be a nuisance, but I&#39;ve a bit of a silly question. I stubbornly believe that my code is working, but I keep getting\\xa0   expected:&lt;1&gt; but was:&lt;0&gt;   I was wondering what that error message means... is it checking the list of observers and returning now many elements are in it? My list contains an aggregated object type &#34;Associated.&#34; Is the test not reading it correctly? What do I need to do?        Could you please extend the assignment 7&#39;s due date. I was gone yesterday evening 044 and also could be see one instructor getting some idea about my problem today, but there is no way to come back there and give another guidance because there are a lots of students and will not get enough time to do that.  Can I add helper methods to my class that weren&#39;t described in the assignment description to help me complete the rest of the assignment?   I tried adding them, but they caused an error in the JUnit tests KMP provided.\\xa0  So when the setPixel method is called how do we go through each region to see if that region contains the pixel. And if it does, from what i understand, we &#34;hit&#34; the observer for that corresponding region. I understand the &#34;hitting&#34; idea is that we call the notify method for that observer but how does one actually go about indexing the number of &#34;hits&#34; each observer has?  Clarification question: If suspendObservable is called, then some changes are made (e.g., setPixel is called twice), then resumeObservable is called, is the observer notified immediately of the changes that have been made, or is it only notified the next time that a change is made? I&#39;m trying to figure out if my resumeObservable should have some sort of notify call in it, or if setPixel is the only method in ObservablePictureImpl that needs notify. Thanks!  I keep getting this error:   Unhandled exception type NoIntersectionException      And I&#39;m not sure what to do with it.      My code for intersect looks likes this:   public Region intersect(Region other) throws NoIntersectionException { \\t\\tif(!this.intersects(other)) { \\t\\t\\tthrow new NoIntersectionException(); \\t\\t} \\t\\tif(other==null) { \\t\\t\\tthrow new NoIntersectionException(); \\t\\t} \\t\\tint bigTop, bigLeft, smallBottom, smallRight; \\t\\tif(this.getTop()&gt;other.getTop()) { \\t\\t\\tbigTop=this.getTop(); \\t\\t} else { \\t\\t\\tbigTop=other.getTop(); \\t\\t} \\t\\tif(this.getBottom()&lt;other.getBottom()) { \\t\\t\\tsmallBottom=this.getBottom(); \\t\\t} else { \\t\\t\\tsmallBottom=other.getBottom(); \\t\\t} \\t\\tif(this.getLeft()&gt;other.getLeft()) { \\t\\t\\tbigLeft=this.getLeft(); \\t\\t} else { \\t\\t\\tbigLeft=other.getLeft(); \\t\\t} \\t\\tif(this.getRight()&lt;other.getRight()) { \\t\\t\\tsmallRight=this.getRight(); \\t\\t} else { \\t\\t\\tsmallRight=other.getRight(); \\t\\t} \\t\\tCoordinate c1=new Coordinate(bigTop, bigLeft); \\t\\tCoordinate c2=new Coordinate(smallBottom, smallRight); \\t\\treturn new RegionImpl(c1, c2); \\t}      And I&#39;m getting no errors around it. I&#39;m only getting errors when I call it like so:   changedRegion=changedRegion.intersect(changedRegion_2);   Within ObservablePictureImpl.      I&#39;m not sure how to handle this, no pun intended. I can&#39;t even test this code with this error happening. &#34;intersects&#34; is my own method that returns a boolean; it&#39;s not a typo.      Edit: I&#39;m now realizing that my code may not make a lot of sense, but ignore that. I really just want to figure this error out.  Not gonna lie, I&#39;m very confused on the functionality/purpose of this method. Based on what I&#39;ve read o;n piazza, we are not required to create an implementation for the ROIObserver&#39;s notify method, but what exactly does it do/in what cases would we use it.      public void notify(Picture p, Region r);  Why will the autograder not compile? It worked fine earlier, and then decided to not work.      Looking for package: a7 Found a7 directory, compiling... ...failed! There was a problem in compiling the code in the package a7. One possible cause is that you did not include the .java source files in your JAR file. Another possibility is that your code contains syntax errors. The grading script will still attempt to run but may not work. Plese resubmit when fixed. Here is the output from the compiler: Main.java:6: error: package a7test does not exist import a7test.RegionHit;              ^ Main.java:7: error: package a7test does not exist import a7test.TestROIObserver;              ^ Main.java:13: error: cannot find symbol \\t\\tTestROIObserver tro = new TestROIObserver(); \\t\\t^   symbol:   class TestROIObserver   location: class Main Main.java:13: error: cannot find symbol \\t\\tTestROIObserver tro = new TestROIObserver(); \\t\\t                          ^   symbol:   class TestROIObserver   location: class Main Main.java:24: error: cannot find symbol \\t\\tRegionHit hit = tro.getHits()[0]; \\t\\t^   symbol:   class RegionHit   location: class Main     Is there any chance of the due date for A7 getting pushed back like A6 was?\\xa0  So this may be a dumb question, but for the ObservableImpl class when you have an array list of ROIObservers how do you connect each observer to their region without having two lists?Or are you supposed to use two lists?

Does someone possibly know what exactly this is even testing? And why I&#39;m failing it? Hi Fellow COMP 401 Students,   I am a little confused. The write up for registerROIObservers says that I need to register an ROIObserver anytime there is a change in any pixel in region r (registerROIObserver(ROIObserver o, Region r). Does that mean that I need to connect my Pixel interface and my RegionImpl class in some way, such as giving my RegionImpl class a getPixel and setPixel method? Because I do not see any other way that I could detect a change in pixels in Region r. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!  In the basic and advanced versions of SuspendResumeTest, my code is failing once the test starts this section:\\xa0   assertEquals(4, hit.getTop()); \\tassertEquals(6, hit.getRight()); \\tassertEquals(6, hit.getBottom()); \\tassertEquals(4, hit.getLeft()); \\ttro.reset();  ...etc.   Can anyone explain to me what this is exactly testing and why my code might pass the generic suspend and resume tests but fail these? I think my code is returning regions defined by the suspended set pixels (which is what I thought it was supposed to do) but the junit test is obviously looking for something else. Thanks!  The JUnit tests said an error because the test\\xa0expected a TestROIObserver objet but got a DecoratorROIObserver object (my decorated object)     I am failing all the Junit tests because of an Unexpected NoIntersectionException.

I understand that ObservablePictureImpl implements Picture, and as a result must implement all of the picture methods. However, what I am confused about is the significance of Picture p as a parameter of ObservablePictureImpl. Does ObservablePictureImpl just have the same Picture characteristics as Picture p (getWidth, getHeight, etc.) or does ObservablePictureImpl have its own distinct width and height values? If ObservablePictureImpl has its own distinct width and height values, what is the significance of Picture p as a parameter for ObservablePictureImpl? Thank you all for reading this long post, and any advice would be appreciated!!!  I&#39;ve tried reading through KMP&#39;s code that he wrote, using something called &#34;Hit&#34;, specifically for testing suspend/resume. I&#39;m not sure what the code is checking for, however. Could anyone explain what it means to fail because of a Hit?  Would it be beneficial to import java.util.Observable and java.util.Observer for Part 2 of Assignment 7? Or is it better to create your own methods to add, remove, and notify?  The debugger is showing me that within my ObservablePictureImpl&#39;s setPixel( ) method, the notify method always calls my own DecoratedROIObserverImpl&#39;s notify( ) method. Therefore, the TestROIObserver&#39;s notify( ) is never called, so the given region is never added to the hits array and JUnit tests fail.      I tried removing &#64;Override from notify( ) in my DecoratedROIObserverImpl and ROIObserverImpl classes, but the JUnit test still jumps to DecoratedROIObserverImpl&#39;s notify( ).      How could I rewrite my notify( ) method call to ensure that the JUnit tests will utilize it accordingly?      My ArrayList in ObservablePictureImpl is of type DecoratedROIObserver, I realize that this may be part of the problem?  My code for intersect is passing all the JUnit tests except for the last line:   catch (NoIntersectionException nie) { \\t\\t\\tfail(&#34;Unexpected NoIntersectionException&#34;); \\t\\t}   Any idea what might be wrong? I feel like its something simple  If we are not supposed to create an implementation of ROIObserver, does calling notify on an ROIObserver already notify the ROIObserver of changes in the specific region? If so, I&#39;m confused how that would be the case since the ROIObserver method would have no method definition (because it also would have no method implementation - ROIObserverImpl).\\xa0  Will we need to create an ROIObserverImpl to implement ROIObserver?\\xa0  How are we supposed to iterate through the list of ROIObservers and find whether or not they are within the desired region? \\xa0I created a decorated class of ROIObserver called DecoratorROIObserverImpl (with DecoratorROIObserver interface) and I created a getRegionList() method to obtain the list (to iterate through the observers list in ObservablePictureImpl but these methods cannot be performed on ROIObserver, because those objects only have one method. \\xa0The ROIObserver interface only contains the method notify  Hi Everybody,   So I just started ObservablePictureImpl, which included implementing ObservablePicture. However, ObservablePicture extends Picture, and as a result, my ObservablePictureImpl class is telling me that I need to implement all of Picture&#39;s methods as well. Is that actually necessary, or am I missing something. Thank you for reading this post, and any advice would be appreciated!!!  In the Junit, my code seems to work fine.

When observers are unregistered by region, if an observer has multiple regions and one of them intersects the region input but the others do not, should the observer be unregistered for all regions or just unregister the\\xa0component that watches that particular region. Thanks!  When implementing the class &#34;ObservablePictureImpl&#34;, besides making it an implementation of ObservablePicture, am I supposed to also make it a subclass of AnyPicture?      I&#39;m thinking not make it a subclass of AnyPicture,\\xa0since all the behaviors defined in Picture interface should be delegated to the wrapped Picture object, instead of inheriting them\\xa0from AnyPicture. However, not subclassing AnyPicture brings a problem that we need to manually type every method in Picture interface to delegate it to the wrapped Picture object, which is kind of redundant.      Above is just my\\xa0thought and it could be wrong, and I\\xa0will definitely appreciate any idea or help!   A7Test.jar       Above is the link to download the test.      I combine the\\xa0suspend_resume, unregister, and findObserver tests together in one method, just a reminder.   For some tests, you need to draw a picture and to see whether the result printed in the console conforms to your expectation.   Notice the sequence of the top, bottom, left, right numbers printed out.   Some statements are made comments, delete // to use them for different situations.   Works for me, feel free to point out problems.  This may be a simple question, but when we unregister an observer we are supposed to unregister the associated region, right?  It seems like the Autograder is not loading right now. I know it was working earlier in the morning since I submitted something before class (hope I didn&#39;t crash it...).   Firefox just stays waiting at &#34;Performing a TLS handshake to grade.cs.unc.edu...&#34; in the corner.      Can anyone else confirm/deny if they are able to get past the login screen?

Should we use a Map instead of a List in ObservablePictureImpl, The key could be the region\\xa0and the value be the observer  Hi Ya&#39;ll,   So I&#39;m a little confused. The getTop, getBottom, getLeft, and getRight methods are supposed to &#34;retrieve the integer value of the coordinate associated with each of the sides individually.&#34; Are these integer values that are being retrieve the x and y values of the coordinates or some other numbers? If they are some other numbers, it seems like they could be any arbitrary number. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!!!  No class implements ROIObserver so where would I store the information of the region that each observer is associated with?\\xa0  Could someone explain what exactly it means to &#34;register&#34; and &#34;notify&#34; an ROIObserver? What exactly am I supposed to be doing to &#34;register&#34; the observer with the region?      I think I&#39;m also confused on the concept of ROIObservers and where their methods are even coming from, if there isn&#39;t an ROIObserver class.  Union only works in the case that the top AND bottom or right AND left values of the region upon which it is called and Region other align, right?  How are we supposed to register the observers with the parameters of a region and an observer. \\xa0I have one list of ROIObservers, so I don&#39;t know how to add to it for specific Regions  I thought I was on the right track with these methods but they&#39;re not passing the autograder.\\xa0 I&#39;m comparing the the x and y of the different corners using if/else if to return the intersection/union and assigning new upper X, upper Y, lower X and lower Y depending on the orientation of the originals of other and this.\\xa0 An example of one of my comparisons is:      other.getUpperLeft().getX() &gt;= this.getUpperLeft().getX()   other.getLowerRight().getX() &gt;= this.getLowerRight().getX()   other.getUpperLeft().getY() &gt;= this.getUpperLeft().getY()   other.getLowerRight().getY() &gt;= this.getLowerRight().getY()      newUpperX would be other.getLeft()   newUpperY would be other.getTop()   newLowerX would be this.getRight()   newLowerY would be this.getBottom()      Then I return the new region with the new X&#39;s and Y&#39;s.\\xa0      Am I just going about it wrong to begin with?\\xa0  Sorry class, I have an appointment with my professor this afternoon to talk about graduate school application! I have to cancel today&#39;s office hour from 3 pm to 6 pm, but I will compensate it by extending my Wednesday&#39;s office hour from 3pm to 8pm, and I am also trying to set aside a time on Friday, in case anyone want some last minute help before the assignment due!   Further notice on Friday&#39;s office hour will be posted soon.      Rachel I’m feeling a bit under the weather today so I’ll be canceling my hours from 2:00 PM - 5:00 PM. Sorry for any inconveniences this causes! I&#39;m having trouble implementing the methods getUpperLeft and getBottomRight. \\xa0I thought I had everything right for Region but I submitted it to the autograder and I guess I can&#39;t get even the most simple methods right :/      My logic is that getUpperLeft should always return the upper corner, since any opposite corners can be used as parameters so:      if (corner_a.getY() &lt; corner_b.getY()) {      and return a if true and b if false?    Should ObservablePictureImpl extend PictureImpl since it implements the Picture interface? Does anyone have JUnit tests they&#39;re willing to share?     I&#39;m not sure why, but I get this error when I try to open Eclipse:             Does anyone know how to fix it?  I am passing the first 5 tests in the grader, but the rest of the tests are failing with the error:      Failed test: \\tFailure object:nullUnionTest(a7test.A7GraderTests): null \\tFailure trace: java.lang.NullPointerException      Anybody know why this error would be occurring?        Are we supposed to make classes/ a class that implements the ROIObserver and then use that for some of the methods in the ObservablePictureImpl class?  Here is some help with the Intersection method.      In the diagram below, the red border is the region. The green squares are the pixels within the region. Pixels are defined by their top left coordinates so that is why the region has some pixels on the right and bottom borders that don&#39;t appear to be within the region.  Note that a Region object does not contain any pixels,  but\\xa0it will be useful to think about what\\xa0Observer to notify when pixels are changed.          Here is a diagram of an individual pixel with coordinate (x,y).\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0Another way to think about it is the pixels being centered on top of their coordinates.    \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0       In the diagram below regions do not intersect. None of the regions share borders.          In this diagram some regions intersect, forming 2 line segments and a point.          Below is a zoom in of the topmost region intersection. The region is a line segment with 3 coordinates.          Here is a general diagram that shows an intersection.              Hey guys canceling my office hours today because of Joyce Manor concert, I&#39;ll be making them up Wedneday at 8am.\\xa0 I&#39;m passing the test for a null intersection, but not a null region.\\xa0 According to the write up, &#34;If null is passed to a Region&#39;s union method, the method should return itself (i.e., the object it was called on). &#34; So my code is as follows:      public Region union(Region other) { \\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0if (other == null) {  \\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0return other; \\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0}      Then it goes on to evaluate (or try to evaluate) the region.\\xa0 Am I interpreting this instruction incorrectly?  Does anyone have the same problem?      Basic suspend/resume test Failed test: \\tFailure object:basicSuspendResumeTest(a7test.A7GraderTests): expected:&lt;4&gt; but was:&lt;2&gt; \\tFailure trace: java.lang.AssertionError: expected:&lt;4&gt; but was:&lt;2&gt;  What exactly is the difference between a Region and a SubPicture? And can the\\xa0rightmost point of the &#34;other&#34; region in the intersect() method be greater than the leftmost point of the current object?  Hi,      I was wondering if it would be possible to post the key for the midterm? I think it would be really helpful when studying for the final and stuff.      Thanks :)  In light of HackNC and a short deadline at my job I&#39;ll be moving my office hours today to Monday afternoon, after 3:30.  This issue\\xa0came up for Assignment 03 as well (&#64;206 and &#64;222). The distributed code for Assignment 07 initiates PictureImpls with white pixels (intensity = 1.0) instead of gray pixels (intensity = 0.5). We&#39;ve needed to initialize PictureImpls with gray pixels since Assignment 03 to pass the grader.      Which is correct? Should we initialize with gray pixels or white pixels?  The instruction:   &#34;findROIObservers(Region r)   This method returns an array of ROIObserver objects (possibly empty) that have registered regions of interest that intersect the given region &#34;r&#34;. The same observer object may appear more than once in the result if it happens to be registered more than once with regions of interest that intersect the specified region.&#34;   -------------------------------------------------      Even though the same observer object appear more than one, it will appear only one time in the output array, right?  I will be 30 mins late for my OH today, but I will stay for an extra 30 mins to make up for that time.\\xa0      Thanks. Can someone explain the difference between the intersection( ) and union( ) methods for the Region class? Both are supposed to return a Region according to their method signatures, but I don&#39;t understand what sort of region intersection( ) is supposed to return. I&#39;m a little confused about the wording in assignment 7.      &#34;A Region object can also retrieve the integer value of the coordinate associated with each of its sides individually (i.e., top, bottom, left, and right)&#34;      First, for the methods getTop, getLeft, etc, does this mean the\\xa0method returns the side length of the top, bottom, left, right of the region?      I&#39;m also confused about what the difference between intersect and union is?        Could any instructor or student explain me that here what does do the &#34;this.setPixel(c.getX(), c.getY(), p);&#34;   Why we are using and what does use for?\\xa0   Actually, I was in LA&#39;s 404 class on Friday and asked this question, but honestly I was there more than 40 min and then they could not convince me or they do not know exactly what this going on? whenever I go there I regret that why I am wasting time here. Please, if some student know what is the usage of it, explain it. Thank you. The code is here.      &#64;Override   public void setPixel(Coordinate c, Pixel p) {   if (c == null) {   throw new IllegalArgumentException(&#34;Coordinate is null&#34;);   }   this.setPixel(c.getX(), c.getY(), p);   }     Are any of you guys participating? I&#39;m signed up, but I feel like I would get more out of it if I had an established group going in.\\xa0  Hi,   I am willing to get my result from the midterm exam to find my mistakes.Unfortunately, I am not able. Could someone help me that how can I look that up? Thank you.    Hey all, I missed a few of the code comprehension questions on the exam and can&#39;t seem to get the right answer, could someone maybe give me a short run through of them? Just explaining which methods you went back and forth to and the reasoning behind them, thanks! I noticed in the lecture code today that java.util.observer and observable interface and class have become listed as deprecated in JDK 9. Is there a better alternative to these? And if so, why are we utilizing these interfaces if they are deprecated?\\xa0  Can we go to office hour to discuss questions on the mid term?  For A7, do NOT rely on java.util.Observer and/or java.util.Observable. Instead, implement the pattern yourself.        A7 posted. See &#64;6  How can I go about seeing it? Not sure why it is not there.  Hi every one, does any one know that what should put the code number in order to be able seeing our scan tron results. I put this number but it does not show up. &#34;COURSE ENTRY CODE\\xa0(MUST BE EXACTLY 6 CHARACTERS LONG.)&#34; and the number is 401001 which is 6 characters.  I came into class a bit late today and was just wondering if there was an assessment/ if someone still had the url?\\xa0  i&#39;m seeing two different grades between Sakai and examscan.unc.edu, is the one on the exam scan website just the grade for part one or the over all grade? if so, why is the grade on Sakai under &#34;curved grade&#34; lower?  will our midterm grade be on sakai, gradescope, or the autograder?  While I am back in town, I have a Ph.D oral exam to attend in the morning.  Hi everyone, I have to leave my office hours an hour early tomorrow. Thanks.  Hi,\\xa0   I think there was not enough time to finish up the exam. I even could not read the last question coding. I think more time is needed otherwise if even you are very good you will fail. This is not fair. I hope that there is some extra credit and also extra work for this exam to compensate it.  Are we having recitation tomorrow?  To make up for missed office hours I will be in SN44 from 8AM-10AM and 11AM-12:30PM tomorrow 10/27.

Or can it only access methods defined in the Picture interface?\\xa0  Some of my friends who have taken KMP&#39;s class before told me that if you fail (below 60?) you get a 0 for the midterm. Is this true?                public interface Phone {  String getNumber();  String getLastNumberDialed(); double currentBatteryLevel(); void dial(String number); void dial();    } // End of interface Phone    public class SmartPhone implements Phone {  private double battery_life;  private String number;  private String last_number_dialed;  private final static String DEFAULT_NUMBER = “867-5309”;    public SmartPhone(String number) { this.number = number; battery_life = 1.0; last_number_dialed = null;    }    public SmartPhone() { this(SmartPhone.DEFAULT_NUMBER);    }    public String getNumber() { return number;    }    public String getLastNumberDialed() { if (last_number_dialed == null) {    throw new RuntimeException(&#34;No last number.&#34;); }    return last_number_dialed; }    public double currentBatteryLevel() { return battery_life;    }    public void dial(String number) {  if (currentBatteryLevel() &lt; 0.1) {    throw new RuntimeException(&#34;Not enough battery&#34;); }    battery_life *= 0.9;    last_number_dialed = number; }                   public void dial() {  if (last_number_dialed != null) {    dial(last_number_dialed); }    }  }\\xa0            E) Suppose I make the claim that because the code above does not provide any setters that follow the JavaBeans convention, a SmartPhone object is immutable. Am I right? Why or why not?    No, because the side effect of dial is to change the value of battery level and last_number_dialed.\\xa0      I somewhat understand this explanation but can anyone pinpoint the specific line(s) of code that hint that it is not immutable?        If you signed up to take the midterm at an alternate time on Friday, you should have received an email from me with details. In short:       Alternate time exam will be given once at 12:30 and once at 2:00 on Friday in the recitation room (FB009).  You are honor bound and responsible for avoiding any discussion of or learning anything about the midterm until you&#39;ve completed the exam (so stay off Piazza and avoid your friends).  How much time should we allow ourselves to complete the practice exams? How much time will be allotted for the exam tomorrow? In Java, methods are always virtual. The method that executes will always be the method defined by the object, regardless of possible covariant casting of said object. However,\\xa0the expected behavior isn&#39;t always found when using private methods.      public class VirtualPrivateTest {  \\tpublic VirtualPrivateTest() {} \\t \\tprivate int two() { \\t\\treturn 2; \\t} \\tpublic int four() { \\t\\treturn 4; \\t} \\t \\tpublic static void main(String args[]) { \\t\\t \\t\\tclass VPTChild extends VirtualPrivateTest { \\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\tprivate int two() { // This can be public or private. \\t\\t\\t\\treturn 22; \\t\\t\\t} \\t\\t\\tpublic int four() { \\t\\t\\t\\treturn 42; \\t\\t\\t}  \\t\\t} \\t\\t \\t\\tVirtualPrivateTest vpt = new VirtualPrivateTest(); \\t\\tVPTChild vpt_child = new VPTChild(); \\t\\t// Casting below is actually not necessary. Without casting the output is the same. \\t\\tVirtualPrivateTest casted_child = (VirtualPrivateTest) vpt_child; \\t\\t \\t\\tSystem.out.println(vpt.two());           // 2 \\t\\tSystem.out.println(vpt_child.two());     // 22 \\t\\tSystem.out.println(casted_child.two());  // 2 \\t\\t \\t\\tSystem.out.println(vpt.four());          // 4 \\t\\tSystem.out.println(vpt_child.four());    // 42 \\t\\tSystem.out.println(casted_child.four()); // 42  \\t}  }   VirtualPrivateTest . two() is acting as if it&#39;s a non-virtual method. The output of casted_child.two() is  2  instead of 22, which is what one would expect if it were a non-virtual method. Is VirtualPrivateTest . two() a non-virtual method? Or is it virtual and I&#39;m simply abusing the compiler in a way I don&#39;t understand by using a private method?  Can someone explain in the Fall 2014 Midterm 2, part III (question with doh ray and mee classes) how m.m(1,2) = 9?  I am not seeing how the answer could be 7. Wouldn&#39;t the switch case only work in case 2?   17) What is the value of x after the code below executes? Answer: _______7___   int x = 3;   int y = 1;   switch(x-y) {   case 0:   x &#43;= y;   break;   case 2:   y &#43;= 3;   case 4:   x &#43;= y;   break;   case 6:   x &#43;= 3;   default:   x = 0;   y = 0; }      I find myself confused when checking the answers underlined in red.\\xa0   (1) According to Oracle Java Tutorial, method signature only includes\\xa0the method&#39;s name and the parameter types.    Available at\\xa0 https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/methods.html       (2) If overriding method is a type of polymorphism, then it must have the exactly same name and sequence of parameters types as the one in the super class. So the answer to the true and false\\xa0question is wrong.\\xa0      If some one can help me with these two questions, that will be great.

Is that my mistake?\\xa0  For my sample class, testSampleCorners and testSampleAsPixelIterator both pass, but testSampleOffset and testSampleOrigin both fail. I can&#39;t find the root of the issue and was wondering if anyone could give me some pointers. Both failures occured when y is altered by dy...\\xa0    Fall 2014 Midterm 2 has this question:      5. Which of these statements about exceptions are true?   * a) A user-defined exception that is a direct subclass of Exception is subject to the “catch-or-specify” policy.   * b) The finally block of a try-catch-finally structure is executed if a method returns within a try block without causing an exception.   c) If more than one catch block has an is-a relationship with a thrown exception, all of them will be executed. * d) A catch block handling an exception may throw a different exception while executing.   * e) A try-catch-finally structure can be nested within a try block.      But spring 2013 Midterm 2 has this marked as False:   F____ An exception that is a subclass of RuntimeException is subject to the catch or specify requirement.      ...which seems to contradict a) above.      So which is it?  Could someone help explain the two? I am struggling determining their differences.      Thanks! number seven is: 7. An object reference is not a valid expression.The correct answer is False, but the explanation under it shows how an object reference cannot be an expression. So is it supposed to be true? For the exception problem 12 in review site.   foo(3):   In the marked line, why would the exception B be caught by\\xa0runtime exception instead of the ExceptionA before that?    Inside first try block. Trying to call bar(3) This falls in the first case: throw ExceptionC -&gt; ExceptionA -&gt; RuntimeException Caught an ExceptionC Trying to call bar(2) This falls in the first case: throw ExceptionB -&gt; ExceptionA -&gt; RuntimeException  Caught a RuntimeException of the very first try block  Increasing x from 0 to 5 Inside the last finally block. Increasing x from 5 to 8  Final value: 8   The key shows the answer to this question as only c) and d). If c) is right, why isn&#39;t e) right? The question only asks for a proper declaration and doesn&#39;t ask for the constant to be initialized.      Thanks!       Image.pdf      In the exam Spring 2014 Midterm 1.   The question 12.   12)   Which of these are valid variable names in Java?   a) 1direction   * b) a_var   c) break   * d) AVar_   * e) more$moreProblems   -----------------------------------------------------------------------      Why d) Avar_ is a right answer. I think the first character of a variable is lowercase.  Hi Fellow COMP 401 Students,   I just finished editing the code style of my A6 assignment. Does anyone know how and where you can upload your edited assignment for the code style regrade? Thanks!!! F 29. Two different versions of the same method can be declared to accept the same number and type of parameters as long as the parameters have been given different names.  Could someone clarify this for me? Is the statement asking if using different parameter names to attempt to define different methods with the same type parameters possible? In this case you would get a duplicate method error, correct? On the exams if there are several answers to a multiple choice problem and we choose some correct but not all or some correct but some incorrect will we receive partial credit for the problem? I&#39;m having a bit of trouble understanding composition conceptually. For ex 2 in lecutre 12, what prevents someone from creating a new AutomaticEngine object from outside the class? I see that EngineImpl isn&#39;t public, private or protected, so it is accessible in the package and the class, so can you create a new AutomaticEngine object as long as you&#39;re calling it within the package?   Phone a = new SmartPhone(); Phone b = new SmartPhone(8675309); if (a == b) {  System.out.println(&#34;Go!&#34;); } else {  System.out.println(&#34;Heels!&#34;); }   \\xa0Why does this print &#34;Heels!&#34;? Is it because the default number &#34;867-5309&#34; is not the same as &#34;8675309&#34; or because they point to different spots in the memory?      Also, how would this be different is &#34;equals()&#34; was used instead of &#34;==&#34;?\\xa0     Hi every one,   Excuse me, I could not attend today&#39;s review session class; so I don&#39;t know that I can do my exam on Friday or not? I have filed out the form that professor was sent already.  3. Which of these statements about overriding is true?   a) An overriding method can be declared as non-virtual.   *b) An overriding method defined in a subclass must have the same method signature as declared in the parent class.   c) A subclass can only override methods declared in its immediate parent class.   *d) Overriding is related to the principle of polymorphism.   *e) A method can be simultaneously overridden and overloaded      Aren&#39;t b and e mutually exclusive? How can you have the same method signature (overriding) and ALSO a different method signature (overloading)?      Does this just mean you can have an overridden version and an overloaded version? The wording is confusing, mainly the word &#34;simultaneously&#34;\\xa0 I&#39;m curious how this code works. I understand everything up to the swapping of the arrays. How is it that we can repoint arrays d and c to a/b as separate arrays when earlier our setting of the array values of arrays C and D were presumed to be the setting of the array values of A and B?  i.e. a [1, 1, 2, 3, 5] b [5, 2, 3, 10]  then c[0] = d[2] is equivalent to a[0] = b[2] &lt;- suggesting that c is not separate from a and that d is not separate from b How are we then able to set a = b, without additionally pointing c towards b as well? 8) Which of these statements about Java interfaces are true?   * a) Interfaces can only specify public methods.   b) An overloaded method cannot be specified as part of an interface.   * c) An interface can by implemented by more than one class.   * d) A class can implement more than one interface.   * e) An interface can define an enumeration.      The answer includes the first statement\\xa0 &#34;Interfaces can only specify public methods.&#34;   I think it can also specify\\xa0static final fields ,right?  Can someone explain why foo(1) in question a outputs a 9? Thanks!  I am still confused by the classification of getters, can someone explain the difference between getters\\xa0following JavaBeans convention and getters for a derived property?\\xa0   https://comp401.github.io/           public static int foo(int a, int b) {   if (b &lt; a) {      return foo(b, a);   }    if ((b/a)*a == b) {     return a;    }      return foo(a, b-a); }    The answer is 2.  Why is that so?   I thought the answer would be 2 not 1.          Why is K 31?         int j=0; int k=0; for (int i=1; i&lt;10; i &#43;= j) {    j = 5;   while (j &gt; i) {    k &#43;= j;    j--; }    }\\xa0        Everytime that I try to run my project eclipse gives me this error:   Exception in thread &#34;main&#34; java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: comp401fall16/Grader    at a6test.A6AdeptGrader.main(A6AdeptGrader.java:14)   Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: comp401fall16.Grader    at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:381)    at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:424)    at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Launcher.java:331)    at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:357)    ... 1 more      Does anyone know how to fix this?

Thanks!  Just a reminder to sign up for the alternate exam time on Friday if you can&#39;t take the midterm on Thursday during class. See &#64;502 for a link to the form.      Because we&#39;ll be using the recitation time/rooms for the alternate exam time and to give the class a break after having just taken the midterm, there will not be a recitation topic this week. Because I am out of town, there will also not be an honor&#39;s recitation this week.\\xa0    Hey guys I won&#39;t be holding office hours today due to fall break. I&#39;ll make them up later in the week\\xa0 Hi, may anybody know what is wrong in my calculation here?   What is the value of the variable “result” after the code below executes? int[] a = new int[] {1, 1, 2, 3, 5}; int[] b = new int[] {a.length, a[0]&#43;a[1], a[1]&#43;a[2], 10}; int[] c = a; int[] d = b; c[0] = d[2]; a[1] = b[3]; a = b; d = c; b = d; b[3] = a[b[0]]; int result = a[0] &#43; b[1] &#43; c[2] &#43; d[3];  My solution is like this!    20171022_010922.jpg   I understand parts a, b, d, and e, but I&#39;m having trouble with c. I&#39;ve attached my\\xa0work as comments next to the problem code, can someone please explain to me where I am going wrong here? Thanks so much.      Evaluate foo(3):             pdf download:\\xa0 question.pdf       Can\\xa0the code from Lecture 10 be made available to study with?  String foo(String[] sa) {  String s = &#34;&#34;;  for (int i=0; i&lt;sa.length; i&#43;&#43;) {  s &#43;= sa[i]; sa[i] = s;  }  return s; }      String[] my_strings = new String[] {&#34;A&#34;, &#34;B&#34;, &#34;C&#34;};   String foo_result = foo(my_strings);      19) What is the value of my_strings[1]? Answer: ____AB______      Why is &#34;AB&#34; the answer? That&#39;s the value of sa[1] in the foo method which returns a string and shouldn&#39;t change the my_strings array. int x = 3; int y = 1; switch(x-y) {  case 0:  x &#43;= y;  break;  case 2:  y &#43;= 3;  case 4:  x &#43;= y;  break;  case 6:  x &#43;= 3;   default:  x = 0;  y = 0; } Why the x =7? The expression is 2. Therefore it should execute the case 2 which case 2 puts the y=4. How it figures that the x is 7? Meant to post this earlier, but I will not be holding my usual office hours today since I am out of town.  My last hasNext for zigzag wont return false. I have no idea why. This is my code:   \\t\\tpublic boolean hasNext() { \\t\\treturn !(x==pic.getWidth() &amp;&amp; (y&#43;1)&gt;=pic.getHeight()); \\t\\t}   The thing is, when I put x&#43;1==pic.getWidth() it says it wont run true for the second\\xa0 to last pixel, and the above says the last pixel wont run false. Does anyone have idea what the problem could be?\\xa0  I don&#39;t know what to do for the iterator method in RowMajorPixelIterator, how do I get something with a return type of Iterator&lt;Pixel&gt;?  How do I make the parameters of an object call be spaced out line by line, because when I go to save it after I try, eclipse puts it back in the compact and confusing form.  For some reason when I copied my adept into my jedi package, when I called _source.getPixel() in my RowMajorPixelIterator next() method, it&#39;s still trying to use the getPixel() method from my adept and giving me an error &#34;cannot convert from a6jedi.Pixel to a6adept.Pixel&#34;. Any idea on how to fix this?  I&#39;ll be running the review session that is in class Tuesday. I&#39;ve got some ideas for things to do and materials to give you guys but I would appreciate your input. If you have a minute please fill that out so I can get a feel for what you guys want to review.\\xa0      Also, there is a spot on the very bottom to write comments so feel free to put something there.       Fill out this google form if you have time   Looking forward, I noticed that A7 will need to be pushed back a bit because it will use the Observer/Observable design pattern that we won&#39;t cover until 10/31 which then will require A8 to get pushed back a bit as well.      Since there will now be quite some time until A7 is due, it seemed reasonable to push A6&#39;s deadline back as well given the many requests for that although doing so just pushes it up against the midterm so you really are well advised to complete A6 as soon as possible.\\xa0      In any case, A6 is now due next Wednesday. Have a good break!  Whenever I run the JUnits for A6Adept, all of them result in failures that say &#34;The next pixel retrieved by the tile iterator is no the expected pixel&#34; (or sample/window).      Anyone know how to fix this/get something similar?  Does anyone have any advice on how to handle the edges of the picture with the zigzag iterator?? I am currently checking if x is even and if y is 0 or hieght-1 to increment x by 1 and checking if y is not even and x is 0 or width-1 to increment y by 1. (if that makes any sense, I wasn&#39;t sure if I should just post all of my code). It is working for landscape but not square or portrait which is odd.        were all office hours cancelled for today? there hasn&#39;t been anyone since 10:50\\xa0  For anyone else stuck on A6Adept:    Approaching the end of a row, I believed that  dx  must be taken into account when determining the next pixel to return, so I used the formula   cursor.getX() &#43; dx - source.getWidth();   to get my new x-coordinate when the y-coordinate is incremented. Looking at the prompt and the example given for  sample , this was completely logical, but that formula does not apply.      Upon studying KMP&#39;s JUnit tests, it is clear that the new x-coordinate is always the same as\\xa0 init_x , and is not actually &#34;sampled&#34; from one row to the next. I hope this resolves any confusion anyone else is having, it took me a while to figure this out. The problem is that the assignment prompt for  sample  is ambiguous.  I think I have the Sample Iterator written correctly however, every time i try to test it I get a Null Pointer Exception. Below is my method in my AnyPicture class. The rest of my iterators work with this sort of logic.\\xa0   KMP&#39;s basic\\xa0iterator JUnit test is because\\xa0   &#34;The method iterator() is undefined for the type Picture&#34;\\xa0      My iterator() method is defined in AnyPicture, multiple LAs have looked at it without understanding the problem - does anyone have any clue whats going on?\\xa0  For adept, my window and tile tests are passing my personal JUnit tests but the autograder is giving me no points for them, and giving me this error:             I have no idea why this is happening!\\xa0 The sample iterator is going through just fine.\\xa0   If anyone else has experienced similar issues or has any troubleshooting tips please let me know!\\xa0 The classes definitely exist...  If we have an if statement like &#34;if ( x &lt; 0 || y &lt; 0)&#34; should it be written like the following for full style credit:      if (x &lt; 0 ||   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 y &lt; 0) {   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0//code here   }      or is this spacing meant for long if statements? nevermind got it! Does anybody have any advice on how to think about checking whether the coordinate is even or odd? I tried to do x.equals(even), but that does not seem to be a method option. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!!!  I passed all the local tests on my computer for Adept but when I submitted it to the autograder it says I crushed the grader... What should I do? Any suggestion would help! Thanks!      ---Grader Information---   Testing A6 Adept  Running a6test.A6AdeptGrader Your code has crashed the tester.

Is it possible for assignment 7 to be posted tomorrow so that we can have fall break and a week to work on it?\\xa0 I&#39;m holding extra office hours from 5-7 today\\xa0 First I should ask can style be regraded if A6 is resubmitted with corrections taken from grade scope comments?      And\\xa0then if we have already submitted A6 to the autograder and got full points but only got partial credit for style, would points be taken off of A6 if submitted late when trying to get full style points?  Hi everyone,\\xa0      I&#39;m not feeling very well this morning so I&#39;m going to cancel my 11-12:30 office hours. I try to make them up tomorrow or next week.    Failed test: \\tFailure object:testExtractSubpictureByCoord(a6test.A6NoviceTest): width and height cannot be less than or equal to zero \\tFailure trace: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: width and height cannot be less than or equal to zero      When my code tries to extract a subpicture, I keep getting this error. I&#39;m checking to make sure that the two corners are across from each other, if the x and y components of corner_a and corner_b are greater than or equal to zero, and if the xOffset and yOffset are less than zero. Is there anything I&#39;m missing? Are there ways to improve your code style grade if it is bad? Nvm I see it will be addressed today.  I submitted A6 last week before the code style guidelines were posted in recitation, and have not yet finished improving my code style in accordance with the guidelines.    However, my code style has already been graded. Can I resubmit my code once I have made my style corrections or just wait for my style to be evaluated for the next assignment?     EDIT: Never mind, I now see KMP&#39;s post saying this stuff will be addressed in class tomorrow.    If I\\xa0submitted the code early without any of the comments to make sure it passes the autograder, when I submit an\\xa0updated version (before the due date), will Gradescope regrade it?

So when I click &#34;import method&#34; it puts it into the Picture interface in Novice. How do I tell it to check adept?  Hi Fellow Students,   I posted a Piazza question earlier, but did not specify exactly what my problem was. My problem is that the SubPicture values of my extract method and the SubPicture values of my window method are exactly alike except for the SubPicture. I find this odd because both of them are taking their SubPicture from the same source picture. If anyone has any advice, I would greatly appreciate it!!!              I&#39;m working on the iterator, and using the &#34;it just stores x and y&#34; method of doing it. However, for some reason my array is going out of bounds.

If anyone has had this problem or has any advice on this problem, any advice would be greatly appreciated. P.S  Iterator window_iter = a.window(3,2)    I think I&#39;m implementing hasNext() and next() correctly but the autograder is saying that   Failed test: \\tFailure object:testPixelIteratorBasic(a6test.A6NoviceTest): The next pixel retrieved by the pixel iterator is not the expected pixel expected:&lt;a6novice.ColorPixel&#64;6d5380c2&gt; but was:&lt;a6novice.GrayPixel&#64;45ff54e6&gt; \\tFailure trace: java.lang.AssertionError: The next pixel retrieved by the pixel iterator is not the expected pixel expected:&lt;a6novice.ColorPixel&#64;6d5380c2&gt; but was:&lt;a6novice.GrayPixel&#64;45ff54e6&gt;   Did anyone else get this error or have suggestions on where I might be going wrong?

First I declared my variables in the constructor as follows.   private int x;\\xa0   private int y;   private int init_x;   private int init_y;   private int dx;   private int dy;   Then, I initialized my x and y values outside of my sample method.   x = 0;   y = 0;   Finally, I tried to initialize my variables in my sample method as follows   this.init_x = init_x;   this.init_y = init_y;   this.dx = dx;   this.dy = dy;   x = this.init_x;   y = this.init_y;   However, for some reason, my x and y values did not change from their value of zero, so then when I tried to run my sample method, it ran in an infinite loop. Does anyone have any advice on how to initialize variables, because the way I am currently doing for some reason is not working. Thank you, and any advice would be appreciated!!!  I&#39;ve noticed that a lot of you have incorrectly implemented some of your Picture subclasses (i.e. SubPictureImpl, HorizontalStackPicture, and VerticalStackPicture). I think it&#39;s important to note that\\xa0in each of these classes,\\xa0 a Picture is passed into the constructor . This means that the getPixel() and other methods should delegate to the given source picture - which many of you are doing. However, the constructor of these subclasses\\xa0 should not  re-initialize the Pixel values inside of the source picture.      As an example, if I have a 3x3 PictureImpl where all of the pixels are red, and I create a SubPictureImpl that refers to the bottom right 1x1 &#34;Picture&#34; of PictureImpl, then\\xa0 the Pixel at that point should remain red - not be changed to gray .      Please look back in your code and make sure that your Picture subclasses are not re-initializing each Pixel in the frame to be a GrayPixel with intensity 0.5, as this is an incorrect implementation.\\xa0 Keep in mind that this error is not being caught by the autograder, so even if you have a 10/10, please go back and check this . It will create frustrating debugging problems down the road if this is not corrected in your code moving forwards.  do we just need to follow the style rubric for the new classes and methods we add to our code for a6?\\xa0(i.e. not the code we copied from a4 novice) Will style grading be applied to A6? All of the A5 submissions that seem to run fairly smoothly on my A6 solution are available here as a JAR file.       http://www.cs.unc.edu/~kmp/comp401fall17/assignments/a6/a5-collected-junit-tests.jar      Are we going to be recieving all of the student-made junit tests for a6?  Has anybody gotten this error message for A6 HasNext and Next? Because my code is passing the main method test I made, but the autograder says that something is null. If anyone has had this problem, I would appreciate their advice. Thanks!!!     I&#39;m having trouble implementing these methods. I was going to use a list but I don&#39;t think we should be doing that. How would we keep track of the pixels otherwise? Use counter variables? Would these need to be declared as fields or? I&#39;ve tried a few different things but not sure how I need to implement these Where can we find the student-made JUnit Tests to check our A6 code against?  Can we assume corner_a will always be on the right and corner_b will always be on the left? Do we know if corner_a will be on top or bottom?      I&#39;m struggling to figure out how to check if the subpicture is within the picture if we don&#39;t know which corner relates to which.  The Junit tests pass in eclipse but the autograder says they dont pass the autograder tests. I have changed my package name so that isn&#39;t the problem.

Basically, the tests work, it gives me points for them, and then something breaks in the test code. No idea what&#39;s wrong.

So just to clarify the instructions, we only had to write 5 tests that test any part of A6 correct? Or were we supposed to write 5 tests for Novice, 5 for Adept, and 5 for Jedi???  Do we not have lecture tomorrow since it is University Day from 9:30 - 12:30 which overlaps with lecture?  Is there any reason why KMP&#39;s code would pass one of my JUnit tests in Eclipse but not pass the autograder?      My other four tests pass fine in both.     Should pixels that are on &#34;pivot points&#34; between odd and even diagonals be considered whatever their previous diagonal was? To clarify\\xa0using the example picture in the assignment guide, should (1, 0) be considered even because (0,0) was even?  I will not be at my office hours today so I will be holding extra office hours next Tuesday (10/17) from 11:00-1:00 instead. Sorry for any inconvenience!\\xa0 \\xa0   Got all the five tests right ,but why got a 0.0? I was confused about what the directions meant by overload so I just changed the method parameters for getPixel, setPixel, and extract in my Picture interface. Then I changed a few of my class&#39;s implementations to account for the new parameters (AnyPicture and SubPictureImpl). Is that what I was supposed to do?   Basically my question is: does overloading require you to have two separate method declarations in an interface, each with their own distinct parameters, or does it call for you to change the method declaration to account for the new parameters and then change your implementations as well? Any advice would be appreciated, and if anyone can point me to some examples of overloading in the lecture example code, that would be great as well!!! Thank you!!!  Some of the LAs have indicated that many people are implementing the pixel iterator by creating a copy of all of the pixels from the picture into a list within the iterator and then traversing this list when next() is called to retrieve each pixel. While this might be functionally correct, it isn&#39;t quite the spirit of the iterator design pattern. Your iterator object really should just keep track of enough information to keep track of which pixel should be retrieved next (i.e., the x and y coordinate of the next pixel in the traversal) and then retrieve the pixel from the source picture when needed.  I just want to ask a very general question here:   Is it possible to index the list returned by iterator function especially when testing the iterator in\\xa0a JUnit test? or I have to check each element of the list output by iterator?  Why is this test failing? It says on the junit page that the failure is coming from the highlighted line. Also, the colors in the setPixel methods are declared as private static final Pixel in previous code not pictured.               For some reason I&#39;m having to call methods in a weird way - if I want to make a coordinate I have to do it as\\xa0      a6adept.Coordinate c = new a6adept.Coordinate(5,5);      for instance. How do you do it normally and not have to use this weird method?  For some reason when I add an iterator test method for A6 novice and submit it to the autograder my entire submission fails. When I comment out the method and submit the assignment everything is fine but for some reason it won&#39;t compile when I just add a method. (It&#39;s not because of the test_names array, I already checked that)      Looking for package: mmadison Found mmadison directory, compiling... ...failed! There was a problem in compiling the code in the package mmadison. One possible cause is that you did not include the .java source files in your JAR file. Another possibility is that your code contains syntax errors. The grading script will still attempt to run but may not work. Plese resubmit when fixed. Here is the output from the compiler: A6NoviceTest.java:83: error: cannot find symbol \\t\\tIterator&lt;Pixel&gt; iter = new RowMajorPixelIterator(picture); \\t\\t                           ^   symbol:   class RowMajorPixelIterator   location: class A6NoviceTest 1 error  Adept has us add 3 methods that return iterators that are\\xa0filled with specific values based on what each method asks for. In novice, we made a class for the iterator and returned an instance of that class in the method that asked to return an iterator. Should we make a class for each new iterator described in Adept and just return an instance of that new class for each of these methods in Adept?  I have just started work on A6 Adept and am unclear on how to create the sample method. I have created a new Iterator&lt;Pixel&gt; class in a similar vein to RowMajorPixelIterator with the following fields:      int x; int y; int dx; int dy;      I&#39;m unclear on whether I need a Picture field for the Picture object that we are getting Pixel objects from. In A6Novice, I used a Picture field to represent a source picture, and this Picture was passed into the RowMajorPixelIterator as an argument.      My confusion comes from the fact that this Iterator for the sample() method does not require a Picture argument- if we are not calling in a Picture argument, then how can we return Pixels with the Next() method?      EDIT: Never mind: I now realize that the SampleIterator Constructor can have different arguments from the actual sample() method.

In the assignment when it says  Second, add the following overloaded methods to the Picture interface: public void setPixel(Coordinate c, Pixel p); public Pixel getPixel(Coordinate c); public SubPicture extract(Coordinate corner_a, Coordinate corner_b);  Should we change our preexisting methods to this?

Hi Everyone,   Has anyone else had my problem where KMP&#39;s code is going to reference libraries when you download it, and if so can you give me advice on how to fix this? Thanks!!!  Hi Everyone,   Could someone give me advice on how to run by JUnit Tests against KMP&#39;s code in Eclipse? At the moment, I don&#39;t seem able to do so because KMP&#39;s downloaded code is in Reference Libraries. However, that is where it went after I downloaded it from BuildPath.  Will there still be office hours from 11-12:30 on this Thursday, which is University Day?  Hi Everyone,   I was looking at the A3Test as a reference for how to make a JUnitTest and was wondering if anyone knew what assertEquals is supposed to do or mean? Thanks!!!  When I try to run\\xa0   Iterator&lt;Pixel&gt; iterator = p.zigzag();   in the A5Jedi, it says method zigzag is undefined for type Picture.      Am I missing something here?

I&#39;ll be making them up 8-9am wed I&#39;m trying to create a JUnit test for A5Jedi but my code below isn&#39;t compiling because it says that p doesn&#39;t have a zigzag method.      Picture\\xa0p\\xa0=\\xa0new\\xa0PictureImpl(4,4);   Iterator&lt;Pixel&gt;\\xa0iter\\xa0=\\xa0p.zigzag();         I&#39;m using KMP&#39;s compiled solution so I think all the methods are supposed to be there and I&#39;m missing something. A similar thing is happening in A5Adept where my p doesn&#39;t have methods for the sample, window and tile iterator.     Can Coordinates have a negative x or y? \\xa0Also, should we be testing for this in our Junit Tests? \\xa0Because I tried a try-catch method to catch an exception when a Coordinate had a negative integer, and it failed because it got to the fail method directly after the Coordinate Assignment.   try {   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0c = new Coordinate(-1, 0);   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0fail(&#34;Should have thrown an exception&#34;);    } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {    } catch (RuntimeException e) {   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0fail(&#34;Expected an IllegalArgumentException but was picked up as a RuntimeException&#34;);    }  Every door to sitters is locked  For the overloaded extract method, should we return an exception if the x or y values of both coordinates are equal to each other?      For example, is it possible to extract a 5 by 5 picture with coordinates (1,0) and (1,3)?      Edit: never mind, answered my own question  I&#39;ve been able to use assertEquals to compare the equality of Pixel objects, but it hasn&#39;t been working with SubPictureImpl objects      I&#39;ve tested this code, which has failed:   {   //p is a source Picture   SubPicture test = p.extract(0, 0, 2, 2);\\xa0   SubPicture test3 = new SubPictureImpl(p, 0, 0, 2, 2);  assertEquals(test, test3);   }      When testing the window and tile iterators, my test passes if I test\\xa0the equality of individual pixels (within the iterator&#39;s subpicture and the subpicture produced with extract), but not if I compare the subpicture objects themselves. Can you not use assertEquals with SubPictureImpl objects?\\xa0      Can some one tell what am I supposed to do with this dash crossing the &#34;assertEquals&#34; thing?   Thanks!  I tried to set pixel at a coordinate which is out of the bounds of the picture, but the provided program didn&#39;t throw an IllegalArgumentException, do I need to test whether the parameters are legal? I&#39;m confused on what the array is supposed to return in the getTestNames method. The write-up says &#34;This method needs to return an array of strings that correspond to each JUnit test in the class&#34;. So do we return just a string of the method names of what we are testing? Or whether they are passing?    try { \\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0iter = new MajorTomPixelIterator(null); \\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0fail(&#34;Constructing new Iterator with null Picture, did not throw IllegalArgument&#34;); }      My JUnit test is failing this portion of my try-catch statement. Should I not be testing for the illegality of the parameters of the iterator constructor?       Similarly it is also failing for the setPixelTest when the pixel parameter is passed as null.  Is there any way to check our participation grade?  How can I get access to previous midterms?  I understand that the point of this method is to return a new TransformedPicture object, but I am confused about what should be included in the definition of this method.\\xa0 Should the source picture be changed directly through this method and then passed into the TransformedPicture constructor by creating a new object? If so, how will this work because there is only an error message created for the definition of the setPixel method in Transformed Picture?  &#64;Test public void testStackPictureExtract() { Picture p1 = createPicture(3,3,RED); Picture p2 = createPicture(3,3,BLUE);   Picture hs = new HorizontalStackPicture(p1, p2); Picture p = hs.extract(2, 1, 2, 1);   assertEquals(&#34;Pixel value from subpicture extracted from stack picture incorrect&#34;, RED, p.getPixel(0, 0)); assertEquals(&#34;Pixel value from subpicture extracted from stack picture incorrect&#34;, BLUE, p.getPixel(1, 0));   p1.setPixel(2,1,GREEN); p2.setPixel(0, 1, GREEN);     System.out.println(p.getPixel(0, 0));  System.out.println(GREEN);    assertEquals(&#34;Pixel value from subpicture extracted from stack picture incorrect&#34;, GREEN, p.getPixel(0, 0)); assertEquals(&#34;Pixel value from subpicture extracted from stack picture incorrect&#34;, GREEN, p.getPixel(1, 0));   }   JUnit above has print statements to show the outputs of my code.   a4adept.ColorPixel&#64;41906a77 a4adept.ColorPixel&#64;4b9af9a9      But if we switch the two print statements around...

Hi,      I&#39;m having trouble with my code because I am getting a Runtime Exception since\\xa0I have null parameters in my HorizontalStackPicture JUnit Test. \\xa0I have an Illegal Argument Exception set up to catch this in the subclass constructor but it comes after the call to the abstract AnyPicture class constructor using the super() call. \\xa0Since you have to call super() first, I am unsure how to test for this before it goes to the parent class constructor. \\xa0Any help would be much appreciated.      Thanks.  When I test my A4 manually and perform the extract function, it seems to work. I can get the height, width, offsets, and a pixel. But the autograder is marking it wrong and I&#39;m unsure exactly how it&#39;s testing it. Can anyone provide advice for why mine is different?      Extract code...      SubPicture s = new SubPictureImpl(this, xOffset, yOffset, width, height);  return s;     My code passes all the JUnit tests for the novice extract method, but fails the adept tests for the same extract method, here:\\xa0      public SubPicture extract(int xOffset, int yOffset, int width, int height) { \\treturn new SubPictureImpl(this, xOffset, yOffset, width, height); }   It&#39;s in my anypicture class and I made no changes to it moving from novice to adept. Has anyone run into this issue?       Running into a problem where for VerticalStackPicture I&#39;m getting this error in JUnit:      java.lang.Error: Unresolved compilation problems:  \\tThe constructor VerticalStackPicture(Picture, Picture) is undefined \\tType mismatch: cannot convert from VerticalStackPicture to Picture      My VerticalStackPictureConstructor looks like this:      public VerticalStackPicture(Picture top, Picture bottom) { \\t\\tsuper(top.getWidth(), (top.getHeight() &#43; bottom.getHeight()));      And my AnyPicture constructor looks like this:      public AnyPicture(int Width, int Height) { \\t\\tthis.height = Height; \\t\\tthis.width = Width;   Plus more of course, but shouldn&#39;t AnyPicture just be okay with taking the width/height values from top and bottom and passing them as arguments?

Will there be a review session for the midterm?  Autograder should be up and running smoothly now. Assignment due date adjusted to be tomorrow.  I noticed the autograder was back up, so I tried submitting my code, which is passing all of KMP&#39;s JUnit tests. I&#39;m getting the same errors as my previous submissions (which were before the grader went down and before KMP released his JUnit tests).      Am I really failing the autograder? Or is this another issue with the autograder? Is the autograder using the exact JUnit tests KMP posted?  Looking at the jUnit test, I see that the test sets new GREEN pixels in the sources of the HorizontalStackPicture that it is testing. But it doesn&#39;t re-extract the subpicture. I was wondering if my code is supposed to do this itself?      &#64;Test \\xa0public void testStackPictureExtract() { \\xa0\\xa0Picture p1 = createPicture(3,3,RED); \\xa0\\xa0Picture p2 = createPicture(3,3,BLUE); \\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0Picture hs = new HorizontalStackPicture(p1, p2); \\xa0\\xa0Picture p = hs.extract(2, 1, 2, 1); \\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0assertEquals(&#34;Pixel value from subpicture extracted from stack picture incorrect&#34;, \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0RED, p.getPixel(0, 0)); \\xa0\\xa0assertEquals(&#34;Pixel value from subpicture extracted from stack picture incorrect&#34;, \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0BLUE, p.getPixel(1, 0)); \\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0p1.setPixel(2,1,GREEN); \\xa0\\xa0p2.setPixel(0, 1, GREEN);  \\xa0\\xa0assertEquals(&#34;Pixel value from subpicture extracted from stack picture incorrect&#34;, \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0GREEN, p.getPixel(0, 0)); \\xa0\\xa0assertEquals(&#34;Pixel value from subpicture extracted from stack picture incorrect&#34;, \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0GREEN, p.getPixel(1, 0)); \\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0}      *************That doesn&#39;t work for my code, but when I add:**********      \\xa0 hs = new HorizontalStackPicture(p1,p2);\\xa0   p = hs.extract(2, 1, 2, 1);      *************after it sets the pixels to green, my code works fine. ************* Does anyone know how each Junit test is weighed when it comes to calculating our A4 scores? My code is passing all but two of the tests and for the life of me I can&#39;t figure out why. I want to know if it&#39;s worth it grade-wise to keep trying or if I should move on to other work. Our IT staff are continuing to look into why the autograding machine is failing. Early indications suggest that it has nothing to do with our autograder or any of your submissions but may be related to something being used by the other 401 section.\\xa0      In the meantime, just use the JUnit tests posted in &#64;376 on your own machines. If you pass them all, you will get full credit.\\xa0      I&#39;ve also extended the deadline for A4 to be this Wednesday. Until you see a post otherwise, assume the autograder is offline.  For HorizontalStackPicture and VerticalStackPicture do we need to implement new countRange and print methods? \\xa0      These are abstract methods in my abstract parent class, however, in the JUnit tests that KMP released these methods aren&#39;t being tested. java.lang.AssertionError: Pixel value from subpicture extracted from stack picture incorrect expected: but was:  //my extract method \\tpublic SubPicture extract(int xOffset, int yOffset, int width, int height) { \\t\\t  \\t\\tSubPictureImpl subPic = new SubPictureImpl(this, xOffset, yOffset, width, height); \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\treturn subPic.extract(xOffset, yOffset, width, height); \\t}  //constructor for setting up the new stacked pic with pixels \\tfor(int i = 0; i &lt; totalWidth; i&#43;&#43;) \\t\\t{ \\t\\t\\tfor(int j = 0; j &lt; left.getHeight(); j&#43;&#43;)  \\t\\t\\t{ \\t\\t\\t\\tif(i &lt; left.getWidth()) \\t\\t\\t\\t{ \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcPic.setPixel(i, j, left.getPixel(i, j)); \\t\\t\\t\\t} \\t\\t\\t\\telse \\t\\t\\t\\t{ \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcPic.setPixel(i, j, right.getPixel(i - left.getWidth(), j)); \\t\\t\\t\\t} \\t\\t\\t} \\t\\t} \\t} I&#39;m not able to upload any new submissions to the AutoGrader... is anyone else having this problem?      I just tried to upload a file to the autograder and when I clicked &#34;submit&#34; I was taken to a page with the text:     Warning : mkdir(): No space left on device in\\xa0 /var/www/grade/comp401fall17/new_submission.php \\xa0on line\\xa0 59  Unable to make submissions/a4/trevors/1506953693 directory. Tell KMP      I was wondering if anyone had received this error, or knows what to do  Currently I am in the midst of working through my code with the debugger, but every time I&#39;m moving through my code and the SubPictureImpl constructor is called, I am faced with this error:    Does anyone know how I can get around this? It won&#39;t let me log in, it just keeps refreshing the login page. Does anyone else have this problem? Not sure how to resolve this issue, because if you extend Picture to PixelTransformation then you have to add multiple methods to the other classes.\\xa0      java.lang.Error: Unresolved compilation problem:   The method transform(PixelTransformation) is undefined for the type Picture   at a4test.A4JediTest.testTransformedSetPixelException(A4JediTest.java:122)  at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)  at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(Unknown Source)  at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(Unknown Source)  at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Unknown Source)  at org.junit.runners.model.FrameworkMethod$1.runReflectiveCall(FrameworkMethod.java:50)  at org.junit.internal.runners.model.ReflectiveCallable.run(ReflectiveCallable.java:12)  at org.junit.runners.model.FrameworkMethod.invokeExplosively(FrameworkMethod.java:47)  at org.junit.internal.runners.statements.InvokeMethod.evaluate(InvokeMethod.java:17)  at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner.runLeaf(ParentRunner.java:325)  at org.junit.runners.BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.runChild(BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.java:78)  at org.junit.runners.BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.runChild(BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.java:57)  at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner$3.run(ParentRunner.java:290)  at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner$1.schedule(ParentRunner.java:71)  at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner.runChildren(ParentRunner.java:288)  at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner.access$000(ParentRunner.java:58)  at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner$2.evaluate(ParentRunner.java:268)  at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner.run(ParentRunner.java:363)  at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.junit4.runner.JUnit4TestReference.run(JUnit4TestReference.java:86)  at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.junit.runner.TestExecution.run(TestExecution.java:38)  at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.junit.runner.RemoteTestRunner.runTests(RemoteTestRunner.java:459)  at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.junit.runner.RemoteTestRunner.runTests(RemoteTestRunner.java:678)  at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.junit.runner.RemoteTestRunner.run(RemoteTestRunner.java:382)  at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.junit.runner.RemoteTestRunner.main(RemoteTestRunner.java:192)     Something seems to be wrong with the autograder machine. Will check with our IT staff in the morning to figure out what it is.\\xa0      In the meantime, below is a link to a jar file with the JUnit tests that the autograder is using. If you pass these, then you should pass the autograder. Work on your own machines with these until I post another announcement indicating that the autograder is fixed.       http://www.cs.unc.edu/~kmp/comp401fall17/assignments/a4/a4-junit-tests.jar         The auto grader tells me that\\xa0   Pixel retrieved after setting does not match expected value expected   but I don&#39;t know what is wrong with my setter/getter in SubPictureImpl.

Tell KMP  I am not sure why I am failing tests for threshold and gammaCorrect transformations. in TransformedPicture I have   public Pixel getPixel(int x, int y) { \\t\\tif (x &lt; 0 || y &lt; 0) { \\t\\t\\tthrow new IllegalArgumentException(&#34;provide valid point&#34;); \\t\\t} \\t\\tif (x &gt; this.getWidth() || y &gt; this.getHeight()) { \\t\\t\\tthrow new IllegalArgumentException(&#34;provide valid point&#34;); \\t\\t} \\t\\tPixel p = photo[x][y]; \\t\\tPixel xformed = xform.transform(p); \\t\\treturn xformed; \\t}   In threshold I have\\xa0   public Pixel transform (Pixel p) { \\t\\tif (p == null) { \\t\\t\\tthrow new IllegalArgumentException(&#34;provide valid pixel&#34;); \\t\\t} \\t\\tif (p.getIntensity() &gt; threshold) { \\t\\t\\treturn new ColorPixel(1, 1, 1); \\t\\t} else { \\t\\t\\treturn new ColorPixel(0, 0, 0); \\t\\t} \\t}   and in gammaCorrect I have   public Pixel transform(Pixel p) { \\t\\tif (p == null) { \\t\\t\\tthrow new IllegalArgumentException(&#34;provide valid pixel&#34;); \\t\\t} \\t\\tdouble red = p.getRed(); \\t\\tdouble green = p.getGreen(); \\t\\tdouble blue = p.getBlue(); \\t\\t \\t\\tdouble newred; \\t\\tdouble newgreen; \\t\\tdouble newblue; \\t\\t \\t\\tnewred = Math.pow(red, (1.0/gamma)); \\t\\tnewgreen = Math.pow(green, (1.0/gamma)); \\t\\tnewblue = Math.pow(blue, (1.0/gamma));  \\t\\treturn new ColorPixel(newred, newgreen, newblue); \\t}   However the JUnit tests keep getting different values than expected. I have read over the code and can&#39;t pinpoint my error(s).  To those of you using IntelliJ instead of eclipse, how do you properly import the jar files for assignments? I have tried unzipping the jar file for a4 and importing to IntelliJ as a new project and as a module, but the\\xa0organization of the files and lack of src folder lead me to believe that I&#39;m doing something wrong. So, for anyone using intelliJ, what do you do to import and then export jar files so that the structure is organized properly and so that the auto-grader can properly locate everything?  I checked this so many times but still got RuntimeException instead of IllegalArgumentException\\xa0   Could someone please help?   And this is my code from AnyPicture and SubPictureImpl      public AnyPicture(int width, int height){  if(width &lt; 0 || height &lt; 0){  throw new IllegalArgumentException();  }  _width = width;  _height = height;  array = new Pixel[height][width];   for(int i = 0; i &lt; height; i&#43;&#43;){  for(int x = 0; x &lt; width; x&#43;&#43;){   array[i][x] = new ColorPixel(0.5,0.5,0.5);  }  }  }                   public SubPictureImpl(Picture source, int xOffset, int yOffset, int width, int height){  super(width, height);   Integer a = new Integer(_xOffset);  Integer b = new Integer(_yOffset);  Integer c = new Integer(_width);  Integer d = new Integer(_height);     if(xOffset &lt; 0 || yOffset &lt; 0 || xOffset &#43; _width &gt; source.getWidth() || yOffset &#43; _height &gt; source.getHeight() ||  source == null || a == null || b == null || c == null || d == null ){  throw new IllegalArgumentException(&#34;IllegalArgumentException&#34;);  }     _source = source;  _xOffset = xOffset;  _yOffset = yOffset;  _width = width;  _height = height;   for(int y = 0; y &lt; height; y&#43;&#43;){  for(int x = 0; x &lt; width; x&#43;&#43;){   array[y][x] = _source.getPixel(x &#43; _xOffset , y &#43; _yOffset);  }  }  }          In a4jedi when we write gamma correct, it states\\xa0      The transform method of a\\xa0 GammaCorrect \\xa0object should produce a &#34;gamma corrected&#34; version of pixel\\xa0 p \\xa0passed to it. The components (i.e., red, green, and blue) of the gamma corrected pixel are the result of raising them to the (1.0/gamma) power. In other words, if &#34;old&#34; is the original component value in the range from 0.0 to 1.0, then &#34;new&#34; can be calculated as:       new = Math.pow(old, (1.0/gamma));        Does this mean that we have to calculate a new value for red, green, and blue components or could the old value be the intensity of Pixel p?    I made my own quick JUnit test to test my extract method for vertical and horizontal stack pictures. I&#39;m not really sure why it isn&#39;t passing the autograder, since I just had AnyPicture handle the method. my autograder error is &#34;Pixel value from subpicture extracted from stack picture incorrect expected:a4adept.ColorPixel&#64;6d5380c2 but was:a4adept.ColorPixel&#64;45ff54e6&#34; Here&#39;s my tests  &#64;Test \\tpublic void horizontalStackExtractTest() { \\t\\tPixel p = new GrayPixel(.25); \\t\\tPictureImpl a = new PictureImpl(4, 6); \\t\\tPictureImpl b = new PictureImpl(5, 6); \\t\\tPicture s = new HorizontalStackPicture(a, b); \\t\\tSubPicture x = s.extract(1, 1, 1, 2); \\t\\ts.setPixel(2, 2, p); \\t\\tAssert.assertEquals(s.getPixel(2, 2).getIntensity(), x.getPixel(1, 1).getIntensity(), .001);  \\t}  \\t&#64;Test \\tpublic void verticalStackExtractTest() { \\t\\tPixel p = new GrayPixel(.25); \\t\\tPictureImpl a = new PictureImpl(5, 4); \\t\\tPictureImpl b = new PictureImpl(5, 6); \\t\\tPicture s = new VerticalStackPicture(a, b); \\t\\tSubPicture x = s.extract(1, 1, 1, 2); \\t\\ts.setPixel(2, 2, p); \\t\\tAssert.assertEquals(s.getPixel(2, 2).getIntensity(), x.getPixel(1, 1).getIntensity(), .001);  \\t}Due to scheduling conflicts, in going to be hosting my office hours 12-3pm today\\xa0The autograder is docking me a point in a4novice for &#34;Expected IllegalArgumentException for y offset &#43; height &gt;= source height&#34; I must be misunderstanding something, because this implies that the two cant be equal. My understanding is this:  say you have a picture with width and height both 3 and you say you want the x and y offset to both be 1. you have a 2d array with indexes 0, 1, 2 in both directions, so your offset point is at index 1. now you want the height to be 2, so that your subpicture will start at (1, 1) and go one downward, including (1, 2). This should be possible, because (1,2) exists if the width is 3. however, this means y offset, which is 1, plus the height, 2, equals three, which would throw an exception according to what the autograder wants. If i put what the autograder wants, it prompts this same exception when it isnt trying to, and fails the autograder test. I assume the autograder is correct so can someone explain why I&#39;m wrong and possibly how to fix it?    EDIT: I don&#39;t really understand how, but I got it fixed It says in the autograder that all of the actual methods cause the Illegalargument exception to be flagged but I don&#39;t really know why. All my methods worked fine when there was just a &gt; operator.      &#64;Override \\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0public void setPixel(int x, int y, Pixel p) {  \\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0source1.setPixel(x &#43; xOffset1, y &#43; yOffset1, p); \\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0}  \\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0&#64;Override \\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0public Pixel getPixel(int x, int y) { \\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0return source1.getPixel(x &#43; xOffset1, y &#43; yOffset1); \\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0}    are my get and set methods for subpictureimplementation   Edit: I should add that the reason why I did this was because apparently the autograder docks points if you only have the &gt; operator without the =   I used the same idea for both the vertical and horizontal stack for adept, but only the horizontal passed the autograder while both passed the junit test.\\xa0      This is my code that the autograder is pointing at as wrong   public Pixel getPixel(int x, int y) { if ((x&gt;top.getWidth() || (y&gt;(top.getHeight()&#43;bottom.getHeight()))) || (x&lt;0) || (y&lt;0)) { throw new IllegalArgumentException(&#34;Geometric error&#34;); } else if (y&lt;=top.getHeight()) { return top.getPixel(x, y); } else { return bottom.getPixel(x, y-top.getHeight()); } } This is the feedback I get\\xa0:  Failure object:testVerticalStackPicture(a4test.A4AdeptTest): 2 \\tFailure trace: java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 2 \\tat a4adept.PictureImpl.getPixel(PictureImpl.java:40) \\tat a4adept.VerticalStackPicture.getPixel(VerticalStackPicture.java:44) \\tat a4test.A4AdeptTest.testVerticalStackPicture(A4AdeptTest.java:66) \\tat sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method) \\tat sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:62) \\tat sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43) \\tat java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:497)   Anyone see what may be wrong?\\xa0  The JUnit test I am using does not detect any errors and the code works fine, but I keep getting this message from the autograder and I don&#39;t know what it means.

There are no generic RuntimeExceptions in my code In which class should pixelArray be defined? I originally had it in the PictureImpl, however this creates a problem because SubPictureImpl cannot access it, making translation of get/setPixel impossible.  Thanks. In my novice code, I just used the following in the parent abstract class AnyPicture   public Subpicture extract(int xOffset, int yOffset, int width, int height) { \\treturn new SubPictureImpl(this, xOffset, yOffset, width, height); }      And when I operate the JUnit test I made to take a SubPicture extract of a Horizontal/VerticalStackPicture, all the tests pass - the tests from the autograder for the extract method in novice and for the Horizontal/VerticalStackPicture constructors all pass, so I am unsure of why the extract method is not working for this.      Has anyone else had the same problem/have any intuition as to why this is the case?  Is there a way we can get access to our quiz questions to practice for the midterm?  Hi, I&#39;m having trouble pointing to &#34;this&#34; picture in my extract method - how do I say that I want the picture from the current class to be used as my source in the method? This was I have right now:   public SubPicture extract(int xOffset, int yOffset, int width, int height)  { \\tSubPicture sub = new SubPictureImpl(this.pic, xOffset, yOffset, width, height); \\treturn null; )   Also, I defined this in the AnyPicture abstract class - is that right? For my constructor for HorizontalStack/VerticalStack, how can I use the IllegalArgumentException without the code being dead?

My constructor for these two classes definitely calls an IllegalArgumentException.   I&#39;m having problem understanding this part of the assignment description. how is information &#34;translated&#34; in order to have a getter and setter by using the Offset methods?  I have almost everything working with the new abstract class AnyPicture. However, I can&#39;t figure out how to make my PictureImpl\\xa0 getter and setter work.

How can I make the getter and setter work for PictureImpl without using an array like I did in A3?

There are RunTimeExceptions in ColorPixel and GrayPixel but those were imported from KMP...      The autograder is printing this message:\\xa0   Expected IllegalArgumentException but got generic RuntimeException     Does anybody have a JUnit test for the assignment they&#39;re willing to share?

How is\\xa0changing the height of a vertically stacked picture supposed to influence the underlying source pictures? If two 5 x 5 pictures are stacked on top of each other (making the height of the vertical stack picture 10 pixels) and I change the height of the stacked picture to 8, are the underlying source pictures each reduced by 1 pixel in height, or does something else happen? What about changing the width of a horizontally stacked picture?\\xa0 Is it possible to define these within the AnyPicture class? Or does it have to be defined separately for each class? I was told that for it to be defined in the AnyPicture class there would need variables defined within AnyPicture and that super would need to be used for the two impls?Which of the methods should be defined for AnyPicture and which should be abstract? In the horizontal and vertical stacked picture classes I didn&#39;t create a new array of pixels but used getters and setters like I did in SubPictureImpl(which passed novice). I have JUnit tests to test if the pixels match in the two images and in different spots of the subpicture of the stacked image and my code passes those but not the autograder. I&#39;m still not sure why.

The instructions say that the extract method should not store its own values but rather that the extract method should translate the coordinate information. I have done this using the following code:         public SubPicture extract(int xOffset, int yOffset, int width, int height) {         for (int i = 0; i &lt; widthVal; i&#43;&#43;) {             for (int j = 0; j &lt; heightVal; j&#43;&#43;) {                 if (i &gt; width - 1 ||                         j &gt; height - 1) {                     pixelArray[i][j] = null;                 } else {                     pixelArray[i][j] = pixelArray[i &#43; xOffset][j &#43; yOffset];                 }             }         }         this.print();     }   Is this the correct way to go about defining the extract method? What should I be returning (i.e. I receive the error: &#34;This method must return a result of type SubPicture.&#34;  Thanks!  So is there a limit to submissions this assignment since we are now encouraged to design our own JUnit tests? And if there is does anyone know what it is? I might have just forgotten or didn&#39;t hear it while jotting something down. Hey guys I am feeling pretty under the weather and won&#39;t be at my office hours, sorry for the late notice\\xa0 What are the points xOffset and yOffset supposed to signify? Do they signify the coordinates of each of the pixels that is part of the picture? Thanks!!!  I&#39;m going to move my office hours Tuesday 5-6 (today) to this Thursday 5-6. \\xa0  From the assignment guide, this is what it sounds like the hierarchy should look like. Is this right, or am I confused?    abstract public class AnyPictureImpl implements AnyPicture   public class PictureImpl extends AnyPictureImpl implements Picture   public class SubPictureImpl extends PictureImpl implements SubPicture     public class HorizontalStackPicture extends PictureImpl implements Picture  public class VerticalStackPicture extends PictureImpl implements Picture  public class TransformedPicture extends PictureImpl implements Picture     public class Threshold implements PixelTransformation  public class GammaCorrect implements PixelTransformation   In a4novice, I am confused about the &#34;delegating&#34; \\xa0so in SubPictureImpl we are just supposed to reference the source, and not create a new double pixel array. \\xa0However, in extract, we are supposed to create a replica double pixel array, is this correct?  Should the values for threshold and gamma clarification also be between 0 and 1, like the components of the pixels? Or can they be any value?  In my GammaCorrect and Threshold classes, I am getting an error saying that they cannot implement PixelTransformation because &#34;PixelTransformation cannot be resolved to a type.&#34;      My interface is declared in PixelTransformation.java as      public interface PixelTransformation {   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0Pixel transform(Pixel p);   }      Where is my error?  I won&#39;t be in tomorrow morning and so need to cancel my hours.  Sorry for the broken link. Fixed now.  I feel like I understand the purpose of AnyPicture, but in my SubPictureImpl and PictureImpl classes I don&#39;t see anything common that establishing a parent class would help make more efficient. Is the idea that AnyPicture covers all the commonalities that SubPictureImpl and PictureImpl would have from being implementations of SubPicture (which extends Picture) and Picture? Such as getPixel(), getHeight(), getWidth(), setPixel(), etc? Or do I have this wrong?  I am having an issue extracting from stack pictures. In novice, I can successfully extract from a picture, but I am unable to extract from a stacked picture. I create a stacked picture as just a big array so there should be no issue extracting from that. Is anybody else having this issue?  The assignment grade page on the autograder now has a link to a participation points report which shows your participation points based on having completed in-class reading assessments and recitation quizzes. The 20% &#34;discount&#34; as described in assignment 1 to account for accidentally missed responses and absences is appropriately accounted for.  The autograder is set up for grading A4. I am purposefully not releasing the JUnit tests that it is based on in order to encourage you to write and share with your classmates your own JUnit tests.\\xa0  I&#39;m confused at how the method Extract is supposed to be different than the constructor for SubPictureImpl. Aren&#39;t both just creating a new object/instance of SubPicture? If we have Extract to create objects for us, what&#39;s the constructor supposed to be doing?  Guys I&#39;m confused by the\\xa0    \\xa0 SubPicture extract(int xOffset, int yOffset, int width, int height);    in Novice part. PictureImpl and SubPictureImpl both\\xa0extend from AnyPicture class and they all implement the Picture which means we have to have this method in AnyPicture class. If we add this into picture interface,\\xa0how can we implement this method in the parent class without access to the contructor in the child class? Or am i setting the hierarchy in a wrong way?      Thanks!  There are office hours in 10 minutes and every door to the building is locked...  &#34;Implicit super constructor AnyPicture() is undefined. Must explicitly invoke another constructor.&#34;      I get the error above on the\\xa0constructor in a subclass, which extends the super class, AnyPicture().\\xa0      Does it mean my constructor for the subclass can&#39;t have the same parameters/arguments as the super class if it doesn&#39;t use &#34;super(arguments)&#34; in the constructor body?      Also do I need to implement an interface in a subclass if its\\xa0superclass already does?  Are we to assume that Horizontal and Vertical can create new grey pixels, or do we need to get the pixel from the original images?      In other words, when we put two photos together, do we reset it to a bigger grey picture or do we keep the original RBG/I values?  i am now working on\\xa0HorizontalStackPicture class and by implementing Picture interface it also has a extract method.   However, I am stuck with the problem of subtracting this class. i don&#39;t know what to do if the start point and end point go through two pictures. it will infect my previous subpictureimpl class. does anyone have any suggestions on this problem? Thanks!  I have three classes, Parent, Child, and Grandchild.       The Parent has attribute parentGene.  The Child inherits attribute parentGene, and has the attribute childGene.  The Grandchild inherits both parentGene, childGene, and has the attribute grandChildGene.       Given this class (assuming Child also extends Parent):   public class Grandchild extends Child { \\tString grandChildGene; \\t \\t//constructor \\tpublic Grandchild(String grandChildGene) { \\t\\tthis.grandChildGene = grandChildGene; \\t}  \\t//getter for parentGene \\t&#64;Override \\tpublic String getParentGene { \\t\\tsuper.getParentGene(); \\t} }   The\\xa0getParentGene() will call the method up to the same method in the Child class, and assuming the method is the same in the Child class, it will call it up again to the Parent class, which will return the variable parentGene.  Does anyone have the instructor&#39;s solution of the exercise coding, recitation 4?\\xa0  There&#39;s seemingly an error in the TransparentColorPixel class for A4Novice. Both the lighten and darken methods create a new TransparentColorPixel as TransparentColorPixel(r,  b ,  g , t). However the constructor for TransparentColorPixel is (r,  g ,  b , t)\\xa0. Green and blue are switched. Perhaps there&#39;s a reason for this that I&#39;m not seeing, but it seems like a mistake. It&#39;s very easy to switch them, but I wanted to make sure I should switch them before modifying distributed code.      EDIT:      The\\xa0given ColorPixel equals method also acts strangely. It will never allow two black pixels to be equal, as in that case the equal_bound is 0. Zero can never be less than zero, and so the method return false.  \\xa0So I am confused about this line \\xa0&#34;The origin (i.e., pixel at coordinates (0,0)) of the subpicture corresponds to the pixel (xOffset, yOffset) of the source picture&#34;      Does the coordinates (0,0) correspond to the center of the subpicture image? As in there could be negative coordinates for example (-1,0) that would still be in the picture.\\xa0      In the picture class I made the picturearray at [0][0] corresponded to the upper left pixel in my head so there could only be positive &#34;coordinates&#34;. Could I do the same for subpicture?  I think I&#39;m missing the purpose of using an abstract class in novice. Can anyone explain this? Does anyone know if the recitation or lecture attendance quiz questions are later released? It&#39;d be nice to study them, they help get me organized on the lecture points! Are we graded by scores we get in quizzes and reading assessments or, we would get full scores as long as we do it?  Will we be receiving the JUnit test for this assignment or are we creating our own?  I am\\xa0kind of confused by the expression of the last paragraph in novice. In this part, how should the relationship between SubPictureImpl, PictureImpl, Picture, SubPicture, and AnyPicture be?      You can and should write\\xa0 SubPictureImpl \\xa0and rewrite your\\xa0 PictureImpl \\xa0class in order to take advantage of inheritance by developing an abstract parent class for the common parts of these classes. You may call this common parent class anything you like, but if you are stuck for a name, I would suggest\\xa0 AnyPicture \\xa0as appropriate.      Thanks  I&#39;m an off campus student and I finally got the two step verification to work for the VPN.      I logged into the autograder, but it&#39;s not working. It said authentication succeeded, and then took me back to the login page. I finished novice and adept on time, but I wasn&#39;t able to submit them because of this.  According to all 3 JUnit Tests, all of my code is right. But the autograder total disregarded my A3 Adept because it said my A3 Adept had an initialization error. So I got 6/10 because the Adept was not read. Has anyone else had this problem, and how did you fix it.    Looking for package: a3adept Found a3adept directory, compiling... ...failed! There was a problem in compiling the code in the package a3adept. One possible cause is that you did not include the .java source files in your JAR file. Another possibility is that your code contains syntax errors. The grading script will still attempt to run but may not work. Plese resubmit when fixed. Here is the output from the compiler: PictureImpl.java:72: error: package a3jedi does not exist \\tpublic void setPixel(int x, int y, a3jedi.Pixel p) { \\t                                         ^ 1 error   Does\\xa020log10(MAX) - 10log10(MSE) mean (20 * log10(MAX)) - \\xa0(10 * log10(MSE))?

All of my code, Novice, Adept, and Jedi passes the JUnit tests using the most recent uploaded version, but I am still receiving a Failed Test for passing invalid parameters through Adept blend, lighten, darken, and equals in the Autograder report.\\xa0 I have double checked that all of my checks are in place, and I am very confused as to why this is still failing in the Autograder.

Rachel Zheng  Just an FYI, I posted a pointer to a reading for next Tuesday. Although there is no reading for tomorrow, I may have an assessment at the beginning of class on what we&#39;ve been covering in the last couple of classes.\\xa0      In general, I haven&#39;t yet set up a system for accounting and reporting your progress on these various participation assessments from lecture and the recitations, but will try to do so soon.

The Junit test for PictureImpl setPixel() method keeps coming back wrong when it passes a null pixel and i cant figure out why.

Fore a3 adept, do the methods darken(), lighten(), and blend() need to be written for the GrayPixel class as well? the JUnit test only checks against a ColorPixel.  What are the characters that we are supposed to print for the print method? Are they the same from A3 novice?  Just a general\\xa0thought will help me a lot.\\xa0      is it right to start\\xa0from the array[x][y] to get the intensity? then ?         or I am just overthinking again?    Has anyone had the struggle where the Unit Test says that you cannot convert from GrayPixel to Pixel even though you implemented Pixel in the GrayPixel class? If anyone has had this problem, or has any advice for this problem I would greatly appreciate it! Thanks!!!  Late to the party and I know this is a silly error...      I&#39;ve defined the interface Pixel and the classes GrayPixel and ColorPixel, but when I type\\xa0      Pixel p = new ColorPixel(.15, .15, .15);  p.getRed();      Into the main method, it gives the error &#34;This static method of interface A3Novice.Pixel can only be accessed as A3Novice.Pixel.getRed&#34; and suggests I change p.getRed(); to Pixel.getRed();      Can anyone tell me what&#39;s going on here? JUnit seems to show that my errors all stem from the setPixel method. However, I&#39;m not sure what is wrong here.

Are method calls the way to go for manipulating pixels or should you look to manipulate the properties of a pixel such as pixel size? Any help would be appreciated!!! Thanks!!!  Should we be adding the % difference between red, green, and blue, and seeing if that is less than 10%, or seeing if blue, red, and green are all less than 10%?      In other words, if red green and blue are all 9% different is that ok?

You will need to use onyen.unc.edu to set up the two-factor authentication.  I was not able to attend recitation this past friday, so I had to download the JUnit files on my own. However, I must not have implemented them properly, because every time I attempt to run any of the provided tests, I get a message saying &#34;No JUnit tests found.&#34; I have downloaded the files, and I have gone into &#34;build path&#34; in the src folder of Assignment 3 and added JUnit4 to the library, but it still does not run the tests.  My office hours on Tuesday (9/19) and Wednesday (9/20) this week are canceled. I will be hosting additional office hours next week (date and time TBD). Sorry for any inconvenience!\\xa0  The grading machine has been fixed. Autograder has been set up to grade A3 with correct latest JUnit tests (link to JUnit tests JAR file repeated below for convenience):       http://www.cs.unc.edu/~kmp/comp401fall17/assignments/a3/a3-junit-testers.jar      Something is wrong with the machine itself (not the autograder). IT is rebooting it as we speak. They believe it has something to do with some firewall upgrades and DNS changes that recently took place. Hang tight. This issue takes our time a lot especially for who like me that am off of campus. It needs to be fixed. The A3 JUnit tests have been corrected and reposted.\\xa0      Slides and code for tomorrow&#39;s lecture posted in the usual places.     I seemed to have a problem logging into the autograder. It just returned to the log in page after I entered id and password. Is anyone else having the same problem? There are the errors in lines 30,31 and 35 in that file after updated A3AdapetTest. Does anybody know what is going on? Hey class, due to a car accident I was involved in,\\xa0 I have to cancel my office hours this afternoon. Other LAs will still be there to assist. I will soon have my hours rescheduled. Thanks.      Rachel Zheng  First, sorry for the late notice but I need to cancel my office hours this morning. I am under some deadlines that I need to concentrate on today.      Second, as some students have pointed out, one of the JUnit tests is incorrect (pictureConstructorTest in the A3 adept set of tests). It creates a new picture and then tests to see if all of the pixels are white (but it should be testing for medium gray).\\xa0      You can fix this yourself by changing lines 88-93 of A3AdeptTest.java from:      \\tPixel white = new GrayPixel(1.0); \\tfor (int x=0; x&lt;p.getWidth(); x&#43;&#43;) { \\t\\tfor (int y=0; y&lt;p.getHeight(); y&#43;&#43;) { \\t\\t\\tcompare_pixels(p.getPixel(x,y), white); \\t\\t} \\t}      To:      \\tPixel gray = new GrayPixel(0.5); \\tfor (int x=0; x&lt;p.getWidth(); x&#43;&#43;) { \\t\\tfor (int y=0; y&lt;p.getHeight(); y&#43;&#43;) { \\t\\t\\tcompare_pixels(p.getPixel(x,y), gray); \\t\\t} \\t}        Hey guys, due to a family emergency I have to cancel my office hours tomorrow. There will other LAs there. I will reschedule my hours to Tuesday and Wednesday. Thanks.  My blend method is working, but I am confused about how to use it in the lighten/darken methods. Is there something I need to read to understand how pixels change when they&#39;re lightened or darkened?  My Junit test for Novice(color pixel) is not running as the statements with Assert....etc have errors. Does anyone know how to fix this?  I have been working on A3 novice and I am slightly confused at the instructions. Are we creating an interface Pixel or an abstraction called Picture(or both)?        I don&#39;t know why the Blend method isn&#39;t passing - I&#39;ve tried the code pictured below as well as typecasting\\xa0 newp\\xa0 with\\xa0 return (Pixel)newp;  and nothing works. The LA in office hours couldn&#39;t figure out why this was happening either.         The default J Unit test seems to import the a3novice interface for the adept tester, I think this is why my compiler keeps showing the &#34;can&#39;t convert from colorpixel to pixel &#34;compilation error when I try to run the j unit test. If I change the class to import the a3adept interface I seem to be able to actually run the tests. Am I supposed to import the a3adept interface or am I doing something wrong in my code?  I&#39;m having trouble returning a pixel in my main method tests for the blend, lighten and darken methods. \\xa0 \\xa0I think my implementation of these methods is correct(I don&#39;t use blend in my implentation of either lighten or darken) but when I test them in a main method I get the following output for example:      Blend(1.0) - Expected: 0.4,0.1,0.8 - Actual:a3adept.ColorPixel&#64;7852e922   Blend(0.0) - Expected: 0.1,0.8,0.5 - Actual:a3adept.ColorPixel&#64;4e25154f   Blend(0.4) - Expected: 0.22,0.52,0.62 - Actual:a3adept.ColorPixel&#64;70dea4e      I&#39;m confused about the notation for the actual output(I imported the ColorPixel and GrayPixel classes for a3adept)      Any suggestions?  If I were to submit the A1 Jedi today, would I receive any form of late credit for the assignment?      Thanks  But you shouldn&#39;t need it to be because you have the JUnit tests already. See &#64;205  So, In an example of the Equals Method. If PixelA is(.5,.5,.5) and PixelB is (.49,.49,49) Would they be thought of as equal because the absolute difference being in the correct range?  in the assignment, it lets us to initialize all the pixels in a picture as medium gray (0.5)   However, I think in the JUnit test KMP provided, it tests if all the pixels are white(1.0) ?\\xa0      at A3adeptTest.java line 88\\xa0     Pixel white = new GrayPixel(1.0);      Seems the assignment description is not as the same as the test. Is there anything wrong for my understand or has someone meet the same issue?      Thanks !      I have passed all of the Novice JUnit tests except for the colorPixelGetCharTest. I can&#39;t figure out why since the intensity is calculating correctly and the exact same if loops are passing in GrayPixel. Does anyone have any ideas?        I&#39;m having a hard time understanding the blend() method we&#39;re supposed to write. I&#39;m not sure how you would calculate the weighted average based on the components. Could someone show an example of the calculation or explain it further?  My code is failing the lighten test for adept, but passing the darken test. My code is the same for both except for the only difference being that the lighten method has 1.0&#39;s instead of 0.0&#39;s when the factor is 1...any ideas on why it could be failing the lighten but not the darken test?  I keep trying to import JUnit 4 but every time it expands into all these different files in eclipse. How can I be sure I&#39;m downloading the correct file?  In Junit test for A3 Adept, in the pictureConstructorTest() method, the program sets the correct color values as 1.0. However, in the assignment outline, I think we are asked to initialize the pixel colors all to 0.5? Am I missing something?  Today&#39;s recitation covered JUnit testing. From here on out, the autograder will be using JUnit tests in order to test your submitted code. You should get in the habit of writing your own JUnit tests as part of developing your code. Because this is our first assignment that will be evaluated with JUnit tests, I will give you a package of JUnit tests that the autograder will use today well in advance of the assignment deadline. If your code passes these JUnit tests, then you can be assured that the autograder will give you a perfect score. In the future, however, I may not release the autograder&#39;s JUnit tests until after the deadline. Instead, you are highly encouraged to develop and share with your classmates your own JUnit tests.      The JUnit tests for A3 are here:  http://www.cs.unc.edu/~kmp/comp401fall17/assignments/a3/a3-junit-testers.jar       To use them, import the JAR file into your project src directory. It will create a package called a3test. There should be no need to copy the tests out of the package, so just leave them there.      If Eclipse shows an error in the test code, it is likely that you haven&#39;t configured your project to include JUnit.\\xa0 To remedy this, right click on your project, select &#34;Build Path&#34; -&gt; &#34;Add Libraries&#34;. Then in the dialog box that pops up, select JUnit and press &#34;Next&#34;. The dialog box will then allow you to select a version of JUnit. Be sure it is version 4 (i.e., &#34;JUnit 4&#34;).\\xa0      Once you&#39;ve imported the test package and configured your project to include JUnit, to run the tests, right click on the a3test package and from the pop-up menu select &#34;Run As&#34; -&gt; &#34;JUnit Test&#34;. This will run the JUnit tests and give you a report on each test run.\\xa0  For all of those in the honor&#39;s recitation, I want to delay the start of the honor&#39;s material one more week. The topic of tomorrow&#39;s regular recitation (JUnit testing) is important for understanding and completing the remaining assignments and I would rather you go to one of the regular recitations instead. We will start with the honor&#39;s recitation material for sure next week (9/22). Be sure to read chapters 1 and 2 from the Functional Programming In Scala book by then.      Sorry for the late notice on this.  I submitted Assignment 3 but autograder didn&#39;t grade it? Is it still not running?  When we are making the ColorPixel and GrayPixel classes, implement Pixel, and copy in the constructer from the assignment page, do we also need to include fields for each class?  Is there a way to only get e-mails from instructors. I&#39;m getting way to much spam to my e-mail.  Due to a family emergency that I have to deal with tomorrow, I&#39;m going to have to cancel my Friday office hours/recitation assisting. Fortunately, their should be LA&#39;s in the office during all the hours I would have been there.      Sorry about this, I&#39;ll try to make up for it on the weekend if possible. Thank you for your understanding.  When is the midterm scheduled for this class?  My output for Jedi is missing one asterisk in every bin that equals the maximum value. This is what it looks like for the first input example (the far left should have 33, but instead has 32):      *\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   *\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   *\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   *\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   *\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   *\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   *\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   *\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   *\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   *\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   * ** \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   * ** \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   * ** \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   * ** \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   * ** \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   * ** \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   * ** \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   * ** \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   * ** \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   * ** \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   * ** \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   * ** \\xa0 * *   * ** \\xa0 * *   * ** \\xa0 * *   * ** \\xa0 * *   * ** \\xa0 * *   * ** \\xa0 * *   * ** \\xa0 * *   * ** \\xa0 * *   * ** \\xa0 * *   * ** \\xa0 * *   * ** \\xa0 * *   ----------   \\xa0123456789   0000000000      I think the problem has to do with my output code in these lines:      for (int h = starmax - 1; h &gt; 0; h--) {   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0for (int w = 0; w &lt; binnumber; w&#43;&#43;) {      ...but I don&#39;t know how to fix it. Does anyone know what I&#39;m doing wrong?          I have exported jar. file completely and my code test right in my computer.

Is there any way to resolve this? It&#39;s getting close to the due date and I really want to know if my code is right.  The astrics are printing the right number, and the bins are in the right order, but the entire image is printing with the columns extending horizontally. I have tried reversing the outer loop (counting the columns) with the inner loop (counting the rows), but this resulted in an error statement.\\xa0   astric[][] = holds the astrics   bincount = number of bins, number of columns for 2-D array\\xa0   max= maximum number of astrics being displayed, number of rows for 2-D array      for(int i = 0; i &lt; bincount; i&#43;&#43;){      for (int a = max -1; a &gt;= 0; a--) {       if ( a == 0) {        System.out.println(astric[a][i]);       } else {       System.out.print(astric[a][i]);       }      }     }        As stated above, I&#39;m getting the correct output, just upside down (or rightside up, rather) with the bin list at the top and the asterisks descending, ex.      123456789 0000000000 ---------- * ** * * * ** * * * ** * *     ...   And so on.      All my data is stored in a final multidimensional array that I&#39;m just iterating through and printing. Is there any quick way to go about reversing just the Y-values in a multidimensional array? Or will I have to try and rewrite all my code to get this right?  hi --\\xa0      I&#39;m trying to print out stars in a for loop that goes:\\xa0      for (int z = 0; z &lt; percentage; z&#43;&#43; ) {        System.out.print(&#34;*&#34;);      }      where percentage would be however many stars I would need to print. However, java isn&#39;t going into the for loop because for some bins, 0 is the percentage which means z is already less than percentage. Does anyone know of a work-around for this?\\xa0     I&#39;m having trouble getting the character array to print in column major form. I did see the earlier question and answer addressing this same question, but my code is already in the suggested form and still not working. My output is printing as one long vertical line, though it is broken in the correct places. I don&#39;t know how to fix this and can&#39;t complete A2Adept until this is resolved.

It could be an extra space or a single typo for example.       https://www.diffchecker.com/           The autograder is not working well. Maybe this is due to a large\\xa0number of submissions occurring simultaneously, but in the past 2 days I have had to wait 2-3hours to view my code&#39;s\\xa0correctness.  I am working on A2 Jedi and I have a bunch of lines that keep printing out before the correct code. Any advice to fix this?      Thank you!  I submitted my code for the third time a few hours ago and it still hasn&#39;t been graded. Is this normal?  All of my code is working right and outputting the histogram correctly. Here is my issue:      My output looks like this:   0:********* 9:********* 18:********* ...   However, the grader&#39;s looks like this:    0:*********  9:********* 18:********* ...   The only difference is the initial space &#34; &#34; before the 0 and 9. My output is completely left aligned, while the autograder is shifting single digits over one space to the right.\\xa0      Any suggestions?  I finished and tested my code and it works just fine, but when I turn it in I keep getting zeros. Also, the output on the grader script is always blank. Is this happening to someone else? Does anyone know how to fix this?\\xa0  When I submitted my assignment the autograder gives me a weird character at the end of each of my lines on both Adept and Jedi. It&#39;s like a black box with a question mark in it. Does anybody know what this is? My code works totally fine on the console, but the autograder just doesn&#39;t like it for some reason.  Have we learned a way to print the first number of an integer such as charAt() for a letter in a character, or is there another way that I am not thinking of to print the final row of A2 Jedi output? Any advice would be appreciated!!! Thanks!  I&#39;ve been tinkering with the program and I can&#39;t seem to figure out how to adjust my for loop to output my stars within the range. Does any one have any suggestions?      Thank you in advance!  Due to some special circumstances popping up, I will not be hosting my office hours tomorrow (September 13) from 2:00 PM - 5:00 PM.  Should be operating normally again now.  I will be moving my Office Hours 5-6 today to 6-7\\xa0tomorrow. Also my Office hours tomorrow will be shifted back an hour due to the tech fair, 12:30 - 3PM. The tech fair is from 3 - 6PM tomorrow.  Something hung up the autograder overnight, I&#39;m looking into it. If it goes more than an hour or two without grading a submission, it is likely stuck. This should happen only rarely but does on occasion. Once it&#39;s brought to my attention, I can look into it and will post something like this indicating that I&#39;m on it and will post again when I believe all should be back to normal.  What&#39;s the longest the autograder should take to grade a submitted assignment? I submitted an upload yesterday and it&#39;s still not graded today.  My OH will be from 9:30 am to 12:30 pm today instead of 9:00 am to 12:00 pm .\\xa0      Thanks.      -Chengt  Today&#39;s slides and example code posted in the normal place.  Is there a limit on how many times you can submit to the autograder? I&#39;d submitted the assignment many times and my last submission hasn&#39;t been graded after 7\\xa0hours  Do we have only one submission for the autograder, or can we submit as many times as we need to and only the highest score counts?  Does completing A2 Jedi require giving the stars in each bin a numeric value, and if so does that mean I have to change my print line System.out.print(&#34;*&#34;) from A2 Adept?  So I ran into the infinite loop problem while logging back into the autograder, and I opened an incognito window to log in that way. Unfortunately, after entering my credentials, I was directed to a page displaying the follow error message:   &#34;An error has occurred.   p is not of type Authen::Krb5::Principal at /afs/isis.unc.edu/depts/atn/services/ename-1/unc_id/perl_lib/Isis/UserAuth.pm line 88.&#34;      Any ideas?  I uploaded my assignment to the autograder a few hours ago, but it&#39;s still saying &#34;Not Graded&#34;. I&#39;ve checked the class names and the package names, and they all match what was instructed.   Any advice?  Hi Everyone,   So I went to office hours, and from what I understood they suggested that my first step be to find the bin that contains the most stars. Does that mean that I need to replace System.out.print(&#34;*&#34;) from A2Adept with like a String array and then compare String lengths of each bin to find the bin with the most stars. Or does anyone have any other first step or advice to get started in A2 Jedi? Thanks!!!  Hi, everyone. Does anyone know that how many times we can submit our assignments in Piazza? I submitted more than 6 times and it did not give me back any grade after forth one. I thank you if you let me know. Appreciate.\\xa0  A lot of you are having trouble with the autograder because you are not using the correct class names. The class names need to be A2Novice, A2Adept, and A2Jedi  exactly . The package names need to be a2novice, a2adept, and a2jedi  exactly . Capitalization counts in for both package and class names.\\xa0      If you don&#39;t use the correct names, the autograder doesn&#39;t find the correct program class to run and will basically think that the program doesn&#39;t exist.\\xa0  Submitting my A2 JAR file is giving me 0 points and the summary says that every output is blank despite having found the packages. Not sure if I&#39;m exporting the JAR wrong or something else is wrong.      When I&#39;m exporting I have &#39;export java source files and resources&#39; checked and &#39;compress the contents of the JAR file&#39; checked.         I keep failing the second autograder test for Adept although the three other tests pass just fine.  This is what I keep getting: Output:  0:************  9:************ 18:************ 27:************ 36:************ 45:************ 54:************ 63:************ 72:************ 81:************ 90:********* 99:   Output did not match expectations. Expected output:  0:*********  9:********* 18:********* 27:********* 36:********* 45:********* 54:********* 63:********* 72:********* 81:********* 90:********* 99:  can anyone tell me why this might be happening? I&#39;ve looked over my code multiple times and I can&#39;t find anything out of place that would make this particular test fail. Does anyone have any advice on how to manipulate the String for stars, so that it changes the length of the star string depending on the bin width or percentage? I tried to multiple &#34;*&#34; by ((1)/(bin width - 1) ) * 100 but that just gave me an int &#43; a string. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!  My Monday office hours will be from 3:00PM-6:00PM from now on. I&#39;ve updated the office hour calendar.\\xa0  So, this is my code to print the final output:      for(int i = 0; i &lt;num_bins_int; i&#43;&#43; ) { \\tif(frequencies[i][0] &lt; 10) { \\t\\tSystem.out.print(&#34; &#34; &#43; frequencies[i][0] &#43; &#34;:&#34;); \\t} \\telse { \\t\\tSystem.out.print(frequencies[i][0] &#43; &#34;:&#34;); \\t} \\tfor(int l = 0; l &lt; frequencies[i][1]; i &#43;&#43;) { \\t\\tSystem.out.print(&#39;*&#39;); \\t} \\tSystem.out.print(&#39;\\\\n&#39;); \\t}   It was printing out the output and skipping certain bins so I debugged it. When it runs through the loop and gets to the second for loop, it adds one to  i  (so on the first run it goes from 0 --&gt; 1) and then adds another one when it prints the new line (so from 1--&gt;2). Then, when the overall loop begins again, it starts at\\xa0 i = 3  instead of  i = 1 .\\xa0        Can someone tell me a) why this is happening and b) direct me on a way to fix it?       JK JK I found it :)   My output is printing but it isn&#39;t printing in either column major order or row major order. I&#39;ve tried to make another void statement as well as another for loop but it keeps printing the values in a straight line. This is my code:   for(int row = 0; row &lt; pixelarray.length; row&#43;&#43;){    for(int column= 0; column&lt; pixelarray[0].length; column&#43;&#43;){       \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 pixelarray[row][column] = s.nextInt();    input\\xa0 = pixelarray[row][column];       \\xa0 I N BETWEEN HERE I HAVE ALL OF MY IF STATEMENTS AND HAVE SET THEM TO THE VALUE\\xa0inputstring          System.out.print(inputstring);          Does anyone have any suggestions?    Hello COMP 401ers,   Could someone give me some advice on how to find the minimum value in A2 Novice? I have tried to use a for loop to loop through the indexes; however, it has not worked since the value of pixels[width][height] keeps changing within the for loop. Thank you for reading this post, and I look forward to hearing from y&#39;all!!!  I submitted my assignments through the autograder and got a score of 0 back. My package names hadn&#39;t been the same as the ones in the assignment, but then I renamed them in Eclipse to their proper names. After submitting it again with the right names, I still get the grader-script-log message saying the compiler cannot find the packages. My output is identical to the correct answer and it&#39;s still being marked wrong. Should I just create an entirely new project or is there a different issue?  Ive been trying to figure out how to input the scanner values into the array but I just can&#39;t seem to figure out how to do so. Each time that I test my code I receive an array out of bounds exception and this is my for loop. Could someone help me find my way? thanks       for(int row = 0; row &lt;= pixelarea; row&#43;&#43;){    for(int column= 0; column&lt;=pixelarea; column&#43;&#43;){       int [][] pixelarray = new int [row][column];    pixelarray[row][column] = s.nextInt();       System.out.print(pixelarray);    }  I&#39;m working on novice and my print is showing UNC with all the proper characters but it is printing vertically rather than horizontally. Can anyone point me in the right direction to fix this?      Java keeps giving me an array index out of bounds exception error when i am trying to define the values for each index using for loops. Is there anything I should look for to fix this?\\xa0      Thanks!  The autograder is set up for A2 and should be running.\\xa0      I&#39;ve adjusted the autograder to waive the late penalty for A1 until next Wed. in order to give everyone a bit of a break since it was the first time for everyone but now, hopefully, everyone understands how to properly submit a JAR file to the autograder and\\xa0the importance of starting early :-)              At some point while working on Assignment 2, Eclipse has stopped showing printed values after the system input. I finished novice and adept and it was working fine but now when I go back, nothing ends up printing. I&#39;ve tried restarting the console and Eclipse and I&#39;m not really sure what the issue is. Pressing enter a couple times isn&#39;t really working either. Thanks  Hi,      I&#39;m trying to run my code and see if everything is filling correctly to my 2D array in A2novic, but after I run it the console is blacked out and I can&#39;t input anything. I have imported the scanner using\\xa0      import java.util.Scanner;   any ideas of what else could be causing this?  When will autograder be up for assignment 2?  hi\\xa0   so, i created the new packages &#34;a2novice&#34; etc. in eclipse under a new java project called assignment 2 and the packages have white icons instead of brown. i know this signifies an empty package but i&#39;m not sure how to fix it since i can&#39;t open them - anyone know how to fix this?\\xa0  I know this will sound like a stupid question, but I cannot figure out how to read the input into an array since I do not know the size of the input. I tried creating a while loop to determine the number of lines:   int num_lines; num_lines = 0; while(s.hasNextLine()) { \\ts.nextLine(); \\tnum_lines = num_lines &#43; 1; } int[][] inputs = new int[num_lines][21];   but this just put me in in an infinite loop (plus, is still hardcoding since I needed to count the number of columns). I then tried a variation of ArrayList, but this seems like it will not work either. Could someone point me in the right direction? Thank you.  Just a reminder to those in the honors recitation that we will have one more week of hiatus before beginning with the honors material next week. Please try to attend one of the regular recitations instead.            http://www.cs.unc.edu/~kmp/comp401fall17/reading-quiz-lec06          Anyone else getting this error? \\xa0There are no problems with my code but whenever I try to compile and run I get this error. \\xa0I&#39;m not sure what this means or how to fix it.  My adept code works and the grader recognizes that it does but there is one test that fails: a1 adept test 2. In this failure there is only one student whose grade is a grade point off, does anyone have any suggestions for how I can fix this?          I figured it out.   I&#39;m getting an output of NaN for the curved midterm score.  According to the autograder, I&#39;m getting the second part right where it tests the code by putting in much more inputs... but I&#39;m still getting the first part wrong. I&#39;ve combed through the code and double checked the calculations but everything appears to be working. Has anyone else run into this problem?      Edit: Nvm, I found out what was wrong. Oddly enough, the autograder&#39;s inputs weren&#39;t effected by the error for the second part but it was still messing up the outputs for part 1.  For A1 Adept, can we rely on always only having 5 assignments to parse through on line 2 of the input?  Posted in the normal places.  I&#39;ve decided to permanently change my Saturday office hours to Friday from 2:30 PM - 5:30 PM. I&#39;ve updated the office hour calendar.  When I run my code on my machine (even using the tests the autograder is running) my code works fine. But somewhere in the process of submitting it to the autograder, it starts refusing to run more students than the initial number. So it&#39;ll do 3 students fine, but once it&#39;s done 3 it won&#39;t do the next test with 11 students, it just does the first 3.      The input code is below. I have no idea if it&#39;s me or some quirk of the autograder or what.\\xa0      String[]input = new String[s.nextInt()];  s.nextLine();  for(int i = 0; i &lt; input.length; i&#43;&#43;) {  input[i] = s.nextLine();  }     for (String s1 : input) {      And then it does the grade calculation.     What am I suppose to glean from the 3 3 in the input into the console? There is no instruction for what this means.       10 3 3 0 1 8 22 28 39 79 99 34      I&#39;m using this link\\xa0 https://grade.cs.unc.edu/comp401fall17/ \\xa0for the autograder but it isn&#39;t loading.. anyone else having this issue?\\xa0  for some reason, both my codes for Novice and Adept are only printing out one line of output, specifically Carrie Brownstein&#39;s results if you plug in the example input. any advice as to where the flaw in my code might be?  The ability to format code is a useful tool in almost every modern IDE. You can set it up to format to a specific standard you may have, but the defaults are really good. (note this doesn&#39;t constitute good style, it just helps with the formatting aspect and makes it more readable).\\xa0       On Windows \\xa0:\\xa0Ctrl\\xa0&#43;\\xa0Shift\\xa0&#43;\\xa0F    On Mac \\xa0:\\xa0⌘\\xa0&#43;\\xa0⇧\\xa0&#43;\\xa0F   (Alternatively, you can press\\xa0 Format \\xa0in Main Menu &gt; Source)      before       After      For A1 Adept the autograder passes test 1 and 2 with no issue. However for test 3 every single grade is wrong. Does anyone have any idea\\xa0what could be wrong with my code?\\xa0It seems like there would be a simple solution to this problem since test 1 and 2 were fine but I can&#39;t figure it out for the life of me.  I am confused about how the characters were obtained in the sample output from the sample input given. When I compute the symbols row by row this is what I obtained for the first row of the array: DDDD&lt;&lt; DDDD&lt;&lt;&lt; \\xa0 \\xa0 &lt;# \\xa0 \\xa0   This is the first row-\\xa0   33 33 33 33 43 43 93 32 32 32 32 42 42 42 98 98 98 98 98 48 8 99 99 99 99   and the sample output is-   DD DD MM MM XXXX   I am not sure\\xa0where I went\\xa0wrong based on the array given, going row by row through the array to assign the characters to integers, so I am not sure if I am reading this wrong, looping through the array incorrectly, or just misinterpreting the directions. Could I just get some further clarification on how characters are supposed to be assigned to the 2d integer array? Thanks!   \\xa0      I&#39;m running these lines and getting an error saying that the program expects a &#34;{&#34; after the &#34;;&#34;? \\xa0Which doesn&#39;t make sense, especially since I was able to run this just fine for the other variables. \\xa0I&#39;ve tried rewriting the line and changing the variable name but none of those worked.  I keep getting Janet Weiss to have a B instead of a B-, her grade comes out to be 83.4 instead of something below 83. I have checked my math several times, and was not sure if it was a rounding error made by Java. Any ideas?  Are we calculating the standard deviation of the midterm and final exam separately or together? After submitting my completed assignment, My answers seem to be all correct, except for it seems one person who was supposed to make a C&#43; is getting a B- (6 and 4 instead of 5 and 5). I&#39;ve gone through my code for hours now trying to find the very specific error that I made that is causing this. Is there any chance anyone else had this same problem, or maybe a similar one?   EDIT: I&#39;ve accounted for all rounding errors and everything is in doubles, still that one wrong point Is anyone else getting a weird loop with the authenticator? I put in the password, and it succeeds to say my password is correct but does not let me into the Dropbox area for the assignments.        This may be a dumb question, but I can&#39;t figure out how to get the console to let me input data to run my code. It&#39;s just blocked off. Any suggestions?  Benjamin Bunze, you dropped your OneCard after lecture today. I gave it to KMP to hang onto  I think I just missed something, but where do we post Assignment 1?     I submitted my first assignment but the Autograder doesn&#39;t give me a score. Does anyone know how to fix this?  If you are able to run your code, but get an error message like this when you put in your input:\\xa0       what are you supposed to do, and what is wrong with your code? Thank you for reading this post, and I look forward to hearing from you!!!     I submitted A1 but I got 0 points so I checked the details and apparently the auto grader couldn&#39;t compile the files. Running each of the tests in eclipse generates no compile errors so I&#39;m not sure how to fix this.      It says this for each of the assignments:   Looking for package: a1novice Found a1novice directory, compiling... ...failed! There was a problem in compiling the code in the package a1novice. One possible cause is that you did not include the .java source files in your JAR file. Another possibility is that your code contains syntax errors. The grading script will still attempt to run but may not work. Plese resubmit when fixed. Here is the output from the compiler: javac: file not found: *.java Usage: javac &lt;options&gt; &lt;source files&gt; use -help for a list of possible options I&#39;m currently hosting office hours from 2:00 PM - 5:00 PM on the 6th floor of Davis Library. If you go from the elevators into the middle of the bookcases and look left, I&#39;ll be at the table there.\\xa0 When I run the A1 novice code and paste the input, it outputs the first two students but I have to paste it again for it to output the third. Does anyone know what could be causing this?  A2 has been posted. Link below and on the assignment schedule:       http://www.cs.unc.edu/~kmp/comp401fall17/assignments/a2/fall17-a2.html      Lecture slides and example code are in their usual places.    Once we upload the assignments to the grader and they are correct, is that all we need to do? Or do we need to also upload them somewhere else?  I&#39;ve been tinkering with A1 Adept for a while and I believed that I was almost done. However, as i am re-reading the assignment description I am slightly confused as to what we are supposed to be doing.      Are we calculating a participation grade or the weighted average? \\xa0      Thank you.  In case some of you didn&#39;t notice the update of &#34;Recitation\\xa0Materials&#34;.    Solution_to_Recitation_1_Exercise.pdf   Do we need an array in A1 Adept to store the list of integers that indicate the total number of points each assignment is worth? Hey guys due to Labor Day Weekend I won&#39;t be holding office hours today or tomorrow. I&#39;ll be monitoring piazza if any questions pop up.\\xa0 When are new assignments expected to go live? I know that Assignment 2 is supposed to be completed by September 13, so I was wondering if they were planned to be put up x days before the due date, or when to expect them. Thanks.  I cannot figure out how Carrie Brownstein has a B&#43;. I have her participation as a 100 and assignment grade as a 87.8. 100*.15 &#43; 87.8*.4 &#43; 88.5*.2 &#43; 91.3*.25 = 90.645 which would be an A-. What am I doing wrong?      I fixed it Is there Office Hours this morning? And if so which door is open? Hi everyone,      Hope all is doing well for you all and your families. Excuse me, does anyone know that how can I upload my programs (assignments) in Piazza? I am not able to sign in Auotograder \\xa0and also wanted to know that should I only upload there?      The best,  Are quizzes graded by score or participation? i.e., are they just a barometer to check our progress or does the score on them matter?  For Assignment 1 Jedi, are we required to curve and normalize every grade category, or only the midterm and final exam scores? I&#39;m receiving this from the autograder in regards to the last test (A1Jedi Test 2). I copied the input in order to see why it did not give the expected output into the console and I see why the output did not match the expected. It is because there is an error in my code (AKA no output), but i&#39;m not exactly sure why. The error message is:  Exception in thread &#34;main&#34; java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 12 \\tat a1jedi.A1Jedi.process(A1Jedi.java:178) \\tat a1jedi.A1Jedi.main(A1Jedi.java:11)  where line 177-181 is   } else if(0.0 &lt; normalizedFinal[p4] &amp;&amp; normalizedFinal[p4] &gt; -1.0) { \\t\\t\\t\\thigh_normal[p4] = 0.0; \\t\\t\\t\\tlow_normal[p4] = -1.0; \\t\\t\\t\\thigh_curved[p4] = 85; \\t\\t\\t\\tlow_curved[p4] = 75;  The error therefore seems to be in the high_normal definition. Is there something I am missing in this? The code works perfectly for all other tests and I&#39;m not exactly sure why I only get this error in this specific test. Thanks. Are there office hours in Sitterson this afternoon?  If we know the general workings of eclipse os it required that we attend recitation?  Is it possible to have for loops contained within other for loops?  I&#39;ll be here until 7pm in SN 044 today if anyone wants to visit for help on assignment 1.  I am trying to upload my assignment to the autogravder, but my eclipse is not letting me finish my export. I right clicked on src, chose export and chose JAR file under Java, but eclipse will not let me press finish. I also made sure to check the box that says export java source files and resources. Has anyone else had this problem? If so I would be very grateful for advice!  Hey all, does anyone know where to find a link to the reading assessment from class today? I was there for lecture, but didn&#39;t hear where KMP said to find the link. Thanks  As the summary says, just looking for some clarification in that department. Thanks! I can&#39;t find the slides for lecture 3 where the other ones are, but I had a question about the switch questions (&#34;Mas fuerte&#34; and kim vs. charlize). I wasn&#39;t really sure what was going on in the differences between the examples, and I was wondering if anyone wrote it down and knows or knew where the slides are so I can go to office hours. Thanks! I have just submitted my code into the autograder, and I&#39;m having trouble with the second test for A1Jedi.      The expected output is:   A : 0 A-: 0 B&#43;: 2 B : 3 B-: 5 C&#43;: 5 C : 1 C-: 2 D&#43;: 2 D : 0 F : 0      The output my code is providing is:   A : 0 A-: 0 B&#43;: 2 B : 3 B-: 5 C&#43;: 5 C : 2 C-: 2 D&#43;: 1 D : 0 F : 0       I am simply wondering if anybody else is running into the same issue. The only difference between the two outputs is that the values of D&#43; and C are swapped. It seems improbable that my program would calculate the correct grade for every student but one, and I&#39;ve looked through my code for possible bugs.      It seems like I&#39;ll probably have to go to office hours to talk about my specific code, but I figured I&#39;d ask if anybody else was experiencing the same issue with their program/autograder.  Is Assignment 1 being graded on only if the code works or how simple/easy the code looks/understand?   Also, do we need to comment and explain what each part of our code does?  For this week, I will be moving my regularly scheduled Saturday office hours to Friday (tomorrow) from 3-6 PM.  } else if (nScore &gt; -4.0){  low_normal = -4.0;  high_normal = -3.0;  low_curved = 0.0;  high_curved = 30.0;  } else {  //Otherwise it results in dividing by 0.  low_normal = -4.0;  high_normal = -3.999;  low_curved = 0.0;  high_curved = 0.001;  }      Is this okay? I am unsure what to do if the person has a normalized score of 4.0 or lower, however if I were to put low/high normal as the same number, it would result in dividing by 0.          Are we required to use the variable names listed? Or may we make our own?      Ex. First_Name --&gt; fName   Last_Name --&gt; lName   Participation_Points --&gt; pPoints      Also are we allowed to create a separate Class? ex. public class Student {}   Are ArrayLists allowed?        The summary says it all. Is it acceptable to use an array for the first part of the program? I&#39;m admittedly having trouble thinking of alternative solutions. xD      The issue, of course, is looping  and  storing all input without overwriting the last line. I can&#39;t think of a way to do that without an array. Perhaps storing all of the values into one &#34;Scanner&#34; using the loop and then converting the strings?  I&#39;ll be leaving office hours today at 3 instead of 4. There is other\\xa0TAs here if anybody wants to get help.\\xa0   I will be at the office (SN 044) tomorrow 5-6 instead (Thursday).  We&#39;ll finish up that last bit from last time and then move on to a quick review of Strings and Arrays. Slides and example code in their usual locations.  I recently realized that some of my office hours were in conflict with the scheduled lecture time. Whoops.      I&#39;ve gone ahead and moved those two hours in question to Friday so I can better serve you all. Thanks for your understanding,      Kyle Bauer  To input the values that will be read by the scanner, do we need to call a method of scanner s? I could not find any methods that could add values to the scanner.  Just a reminder that we will be starting recitations with course material this week on Friday. You can expect a low-stakes assessment that will be part of the participation grade at the beginning of each recitation.      COMP 401H students in the honors recitation will meet this week as well. Students in the honors recitation are expected to cover any posted materials from the regular recitation independently as self-study. There is a required textbook for COMP 401H students: Functional Programming In Scala by\\xa0Paul Chiusano and Runar Bjarnason.\\xa0  I just posted and pinned an office hour calendar organized by person. I&#39;m still waiting to hear from a number of LAs so there will be more hours posted soon but I wanted to get it up as we will start holding hours tomorrow. \\xa0I&#39;ll also post it by day/office instead of by person once it&#39;s complete.      This calendar is a general plan during normal weeks but of course during holidays or official university breaks, office hours will not be held. If individual people need to change their office hours temporarily or cancel for some reason, they will make a Piazza post indicating so. If there is a permanent change, we&#39;ll update the posted calendar as well.  For the normalized scores, do we give a curve to scores that are 2.0 or greater? In any case would 2.0 be considered the lower bound and if so what would the higher one be?\\xa0  If any of you saw a notification about a post concerning office hours that seemed confusing, it is because I posted it into the wrong class. I&#39;ve taken the post down. A class appropriate post with the office hours calendar will be forthcoming.  I took 116 so I am trying to figure out Java as I go! In the instructions for Adept, it says the variables should be\\xa0   A1_Points ... AN_Points   Does this represent a type of function/way to express variables in Java or do I need to hardcode point names myself? Does this simply relate to the number of assignments as the first input?  Thanks!     I&#39;ll pick up from where we left off before. Same slides and example code as lecture 2.  In A1 Novice, when it says that the first input will be an integer greater than 0 and then the following inputs will be First Name, Last Name, Assignment Grade etc., are these inputs that we will be putting in or are they inputs that the console will be putting in? Because in the intro paragraph of the assignment it says that the source of input will be the console.\\xa0  I&#39;m having this strange formatting issue in the A1 adept program where I can&#39;t seem to have all the names show up at once, and I need to press enter once after running the program to get the final name to show. Does the autograder count this kind of problem as incorrect? I have tried multiple ways of expressing the loop but can&#39;t find anyway to make it format correctly.  Have the office hours for the new semester already begun?   If so, when are they?  Could anyone explain the logistics of getting all of my novice scanner inputs on the same line?  In the assignment description it says to map each weighted average to a letter grade. Does this mean we should just make sure they correspond correctly, or do we actually have to use a HashMap in our code to achieve the desired result?  I was wondering when you&#39;d post how to submit our programs or if you could give extra credit assignments.  I am trying to compile my code for A1 Novice but eclipse returns an error message that reads &#34;Editor does not contain a main type&#34;. does anyone know how to fix this?      Thank you    To find the final grade, I have created a separate code block for calculating the participation points and the total weighted average. All my grades are being assigned F&#39;s, however. I don&#39;t think the error is in my code that assigns wAve to a letter grade because I used what I had from novice, so I&#39;m thinking the error is in my math.      PS - excuse my variable names    //factors 20% reduction and finds possible participation points double pPts = .15 * pGrade/(totalPPts*.8); if (pPts &gt; 100) { \\tpPts = 100;}  //finds weighted average    double wAve; wAve = pPts &#43; ((totalAss/possAssPts) * .4) &#43; (midterm *.2) &#43; (finalExam * .2);          Whenever I try to run the A1 Novice program, I get an error message stating:      &#34;Editor does not contain a main type.&#34;      Do I have to change some settings in eclipse or something?        I have been trying to import my assignment but i can&#39;t seem to figure out how to do it. I click import and then it brings me to a screen with multiple folders that say &#34;General&#34; and &#34;Git&#34; and so on, which one should I click?  For A1 Novice, should we allow for user input for the person&#39;s information, or simply use the names and grades given to us in the examples?      Thank you!  Hey Fellow COMP 401ers,   I just have a general question about A1Novice in Assignment 1. How do we print out, return, or see our outputs if both methods are void?  I am trying to typecast two integer values into doubles so that I can divide them, but eclipse is returning an error message. \\xa0For example:      int x=1;   int y=2;   double r = double(x)/double(y);      returns the error message &#34;Syntax error on token &#34;double&#34;, delete this token&#34;      Does anyone know what the problem is? \\xa0  I&#39;m fairly certain my code is correct. However, the output of the code using the given input code does not match that of the example output on the assignment page. For example, in Adept, I output a score of a C&#43; for Corin Tucker, when the assignment shows a B-. Calculating the scores by plugging (85/125)*.15&#43;(48/60)*.4&#43;.754*.2&#43;.812*.25 manually into any calculator also agrees with his score being C&#43;. Is this a mistake in the assignment?  If a student gets a 99 on their assignment grade, 99 on their participation, 70 on their midterm, and a 90 on their final, they will end up with a weighted average of 90.95. Would this round up to an A-? &lt; 90 is a B&#43;, and &gt;91 is an A-.  Is recitation mandatory this week?\\xa0  For the a1 novice exercise, should we be able to input information for multiple students at one time and be able to have all of their grades returned? Or are we supposed to only input the information for one student and return one grade at a time?    \\xa0     Here is the assignment/class schedule on a platform that lets you add your other classes and assignments:   \\xa0   https://www.syllabye.com/shareableclass/On7UxUhGD3j6Tmaz3CaV15036103931425       Obviously there is not too much information to work with at this point, make sure to pay attention to KMP for any and all updates and class information.    If you missed the reading assessment at the beginning of class today, it is below:      https://goo.gl/forms/H89r2NlAs1jlvIaO2       The system.in command seems to not be running properly. My program goes right to the process method without prompting for input. I was one of the people not originally enrolled in this class, and I haven&#39;t been able to access any of the assignments. Are the assignments on Sakai? Will I automatically be added to Sakai once I&#39;m officially enrolled?  Slides and a jar of code for the examples I&#39;ll be using tomorrow are up now. See &#64;8 for links to those places.\\xa0 Did I hear KMP right that we can go to any recitation regardless of which one we are signed up for? Eclipse is saying the JAR file is corrupted. \\xa0Am I importing it incorrectly? \\xa0I followed the instructions posted earlier today, but I can&#39;t seem to get it to work right. \\xa0Thanks!  Hi Everyone,   Sorry for all the questions. But can anyone give me advice on how to import Assignment 1 to Eclipse? I have downloaded the jar file, but my Eclipse is saying that I cannot import the file from my local repository. Thank you all for the help!!!  I am using a while loop in order to calculate the output for the name and grade. However, when I run the code it fails to output the name and grade for Janet Weiss (i.e. the only output is      C. Brownstein A- C. Tucker B&#43;    . There appear to be no error codes. The while loop condition is based off the first integer.

Dr. Pozefsky, our Director of Undergraduate Studies, has decided that because enrollments in the two 401 sections is imbalanced, any student who is trying to register for 401 and can take the other section should do so and any student already registered for the other section will need to remain there.        Hi everyone. Does anyone have any advice on how to download Java SDK on a Mac? I have tried to download it, but it only leads me to a box labeled &#34;Java 8 Update 144&#34; that I need to install. I clicked on the box to install it, but then I could not find it in my applications after the installation was said to be complete. If anyone could give me advice, it would be much appreciated!!!!  Someone found a bug in my assignment writeup. Specifically, the output of the A1 Jedi example was not correct as originally posted. It has been updated to be correct now.\\xa0  Given example:   5 5 10 10 10 25 125 5 Carrie Brownstein 110 5 7 8.5 10 21 75 94 Corin Tucker 85 0 10 10 8 20 77 90 Janet Weiss 70 4 9 9.5 7.5 22.5 76 50 Polly Perfect 125 5 10 10 10 25 95 100 Frank Failure 25 5 5 5 5 5 45 50      Corin Tucker:   Participation: (85/(125*0.8)) = 85   Assignments: 100*(0&#43;10&#43;10&#43;8&#43;20)/(5&#43;10&#43;10&#43;10&#43;25) = 100*(48/60) = 80   Midterm:\\xa0   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Standard Deviation from (75,77,76,95,45) = 16.095   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Average = 73.6   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Normalized = (77-73.6)/16.095 = 0.211   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Curved Score = (((normalized_score - low_normal) / (high_normal - low_normal)) * (high_curved - low_curved)) &#43; low_curved   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Curved Score = (((0.211 - 0) / (1 - 0)) * (94 - 85)) &#43;\\xa085 = 86.9      Final:\\xa0   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Standard Deviation from (94,90,50,100,50) =\\xa022.112   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Average = 76.8   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Normalized = (90-76.8)/22.112 = 0.597   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Curved Score = (((normalized_score - low_normal) / (high_normal - low_normal)) * (high_curved - low_curved)) &#43; low_curved   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Curved Score = (((0.597 - 0) / (1 - 0)) * (94 - 85)) &#43;\\xa085 = 90.4      WA\\xa0= 85*0.15 &#43; 80*0.40 &#43;\\xa086.9*0.20 &#43; 90.4*0.25 = 84.7   Weighted Average\\tLetter Grade WA &gt;= 94%\\tA 90% &lt;= WA &lt; 94%\\tA- 86% &lt;= WA &lt; 90%\\tB&#43; 83% &lt;= WA &lt; 86%\\tB 80% &lt;= WA &lt; 83%\\tB- 76% &lt;= WA &lt; 80%\\tC&#43; 73% &lt;= WA &lt; 76%\\tC 70% &lt;= WA &lt; 73%\\tC- 65% &lt;= WA &lt; 70%\\tD&#43; 60% &lt;= WA &lt; 65%\\tD WA &lt; 60%\\tF   Therefore, an 84.7 would correspond to a B, though the example output exists as the following:   A : 1 A-: 0 B&#43;: 1 B : 0 B-: 2 C&#43;: 0 C : 0 C-: 0 D&#43;: 0 D : 0 F : 1   Since the provided grade distribution does not have a B, I am unsure of whether I am misinterpreting something here, or if the provided solution is not correct.

We've put together this list of tips you might find handy as you get started:      Ask questions!   The best way to get answers is to ask questions! Ask questions on Piazza rather than emailing your teaching staff so everyone can benefit from the response (and so you can get answers from classmates who are up as late as you are).     Edit questions and answers wiki-style.   Think of Piazza as a Q&A wiki for your class. Every question has just a single  students' answer  that students can edit collectively (and a single  instructors’ answer  for instructors).      Add a followup to comment or ask further questions.   To comment on or ask further questions about a post, start a  followup discussion . Mark it resolved when the issue has been addressed, and add any relevant information back into the Q&A above.      Go anonymous.   Shy? No problem. You can always opt to post or edit anonymously.      Tag your posts.   It's far more convenient to find all posts about your Homework 3 or Midterm 1 when the posts are tagged. Type a “#” before a key word to tag. Click a blue tag in a post or the question feed to filter for all posts that share that tag.      Format code and equations.   Adding a code snippet? Click the  pre  or  tt  button in the question editor to add pre-formatted or inline teletype text.  Mathematical equation?

Anyone has any ideas? Thanks a lot!  I thought I submitted to grade scope my code style assignment, however, it did not seem to fully upload it ( i did it around 11:58). When I went to check it, it seems that I cannot submit it again. Is there a way I can submit my assignment? I committed my changes to Github 12 hours ago, so I did not do anything after the deadline, so do I get points of???  I am currently trying to submit my CodeStyle assignment to GradeScope about an hour and a half after the deadline, but the tab for the assignment is not allowing me to even click into it for submission. I don&#39;t remember hearing/seeing anything about late submissions not being accepted and so am assuming this is a mix-up.\\xa0      On another note, I ended up deciding to stay up and put more time into the assignment to give it more thought and complete it as thoroughly as I felt possible. With this being said, I was wondering if the &#34;7/10 and up&#34; rule still applies to assignments turned in after the deadline after the &#34;late-penalty&#34; up to that point has been applied. By this I mean that, because I only turned in the assignment an hour and a half late on the same night, if my score after being graded and having the late penalty applied to it still is above a 70%, would it be possible to still receive full credit? Otherwise, it could have been better for me just to have turned it in by the deadline without giving it as much thought.\\xa0      Thanks so much.  For the order of the methods, should we worry about having them in the same order to match up with the interface?  If a method can be turned into a default method in the interface, should we change it as such or just leave it?  For some reason in my code when my program creates hand it passes the array of cards to new PokerHandImpl but for some reason hand is null.   So when I&#39;m debugging and I step over the line:   PokerHand hand =  new  PokerHandImpl(cards);   when:   Card[] cards = { two_of_hearts ,  three_of_hearts ,  four_of_hearts ,  five_of_hearts ,  six_of_hearts };   hand equals null even though none of the cards in the cards array are null. Could I get some help?  What&#39;s the best way to get a uniform background color in TicTacToe? I&#39;ve tried a bunch of things and I am stuck.  After I imported A7 into Eclipse,\\xa0this error message shows up on\\xa0ExampleGame.java:             And I tried to run\\xa0ExampleGame.java, the console shows this error message:          So far I have\\xa0tried to reimport the entire A7 as well as deleted the JRE System Library from building path and added it again under\\xa0the Modulepath. How can I fix this problem?           Which will be considered better code style?\\xa0   if (cardsInHand[i].getSuit() != cardsInHand[0].getSuit()) { \\t\\t\\t\\treturn false; \\t\\t\\t}   or\\xa0   if (cardsInHand[i].getSuit() != cardsInHand[0].getSuit()) return false;   or\\xa0   it doesnt matter     In CardImpl there&#39;s a String[] called strings, in strings[0] and strings[1] there are null values. I tried removing these and saw that they didn&#39;t affect the jUnit tests but I was wondering if it&#39;s bad code style to have these null values in? I&#39;m not sure if I should leave it as is or if I should take them out.  For the CodeStyle assignment, I understand we need to be changing things such as method names and variables to be more accurate as well as adding comments to make code more readable. However, I don&#39;t fully understand how much we should edit the way the method code is written if we should at all.  Thanks!  There appears to be a difference between the content of the code and what is expected from the JUnit tests. For example the JUnit tests expect to receive the original deck of cards from getCards but instead gets a clone. Should this be fixed in the actual code or should this be ignored even though the JUnit tests fail?  are we allowed to import java.util.Arrays? or should we do everything without extra libraries?  I had a question about the example game. In the main method, the parameter is a string[], but I don&#39;t understand why. Could someone please explain this?  Are we allowed to remove unnecessary   helper   methods such as isTheWheel() in PokerHandImpl? Or should we just fix existing methods?\\xa0And can I add an extra field to easily get rid of multiple lines of code?  Should we add comments for the getters, or are those obvious enough that we don&#39;t need to?  What is the purpose of setting num = 0 if num &lt; 0 in the find_pair_starting_at(int num) method in PokerHandImpl?     Do we need to write a comment for every method or just for methods we think is important?   Thanks!  I&#39;ve never played poker so I&#39;m not sure about this.      What does card_array in PokerHandImpl represent? I know it&#39;s an instance field for 5 card objects in an array but what does it represent in the game?  What is the variable named cidx in DeckImpl? I&#39;m not sure what the findAndRemove() method is in the deck. Can someone please tell me what it is doing? If we changed method names in the class, should we change the method names in the JUnit tests?  In the code style guide, it never specifically mentioned return statements. I was just wondering if it is necessary to change the original return statement of :   return ((pairIndex != -1) &amp;&amp;   noOtherPairs);      to   if(noOtherPairs &amp;&amp;   pairIndex != -1) {  return true;   }  return false;  What is the hasHand method in DeckImpl supposed to do? I didn&#39;t see anything about it on the write up so I don&#39;t know how to fix/comment on it.      Update - got it!  Does it matter what type of exception we throw throughout the methods if\\xa0a variable is null or doesn&#39;t match the criteria? I&#39;m still not sure on when to use Runtime vs. IllegalArgument, etc.  I only changed the variable names but my junit test keeps stopping at &#34;two_pair_hand.compareTo(full_house_hand)&#34;.  I remember during recitation the other day, Katherine mentioned that we should pay attention to where methods return a variable instead of a value like true/false, ints, etc. If I&#39;m right, she mentioned that we should return the value and not be returning a variable for any return statements. I think there&#39;s one specific method that doesn&#39;t do this and we&#39;re supposed to fix it.      Just confirming if this is true and if it&#39;s being looked at for Code Style?     Do we need to pay attention to code styles for A7 currently and A8 in the future? I have some questions on codestyle assignment.  - Are we expected to style/comment the JUnit tests or just the assignment files? - Is it ok to make methods in the interface public explicitly? Or, should we leave it as defaults? Do we touch/comment on Deck and DeckImpl at all? It&#39;s not mentioned on the Github ReadMe file, so I&#39;d assume we can ignore it (besides maybe fixing some formatting and translating changed variable names)?  Should we comment method descriptions in the interface, the implementations, or both? Also, do constructors need comments (to explain exception tests,etc.)?      For boolean contains(Card c).. are we expected to follow the Github guidelines of using &#34;c&#34; as our\\xa0name, or should we follow the regular guidelines and use a non-single character name such as &#34;card&#34;?  Is it possible that we have some more final practice exams(like finals in fall18 or spring19)? I found it really helpful to finish every midterm practice exams and would like to do the same in final again. Thanks!  In the interface, class, or both? If we do both is that over-commenting?  Just wonder when will our midterm grades be finalized? Thanks!  Do we get to resubmit the code style assignment if we don&#39;t get full credit the first time it is graded? Is the code style assignment due by 6 am on Sunday (meaning we don&#39;t have Sunday to work on it) ?   In recitation, we were told not to under-comment\\xa0our code and at the same time not to over-comment our code. I wanted to ask to what extent we would comment the following function:   \\tpublic boolean isOnePair() {  \\t\\tint pair_idx = findFirstPair(0);  \\t\\tboolean no_other_pairs = findFirstPair(pair_idx&#43;1) == -1; \\t\\t \\t\\treturn ((pair_idx != -1) &amp;&amp; no_other_pairs); \\t\\t \\t}      What I currently have is pasted below, is that too much?      \\t/* Implementation of isOnePair() method \\t * Output: true if current poker hand is one pair \\t *         false if current poker hand is not one pair \\t */\\t \\tpublic boolean isOnePair() { \\t\\t//Find the index of the first pair in our hand \\t\\tint pair_idx = findFirstPair(0); \\t\\t \\t\\t//See if there are any other pairs in our hand \\t\\tboolean no_other_pairs = findFirstPair(pair_idx&#43;1) == -1; \\t\\t \\t\\t//Only return true if we found exactly one pair, false otherwise \\t\\treturn ((pair_idx != -1) &amp;&amp; no_other_pairs); \\t}     Thank you! There’s talk in the CS department and the College of arts and sciences that the department will have to LIMIT the number of CS majors in order to accommodate the growing number of students in the major. This policy may not affect you, but it will affect our future and current undergraduate classmates, especially those in underrepresented communities. If we want to support growth in our CS community, we feel the college should add faculty instead of having an admission policy that limits student opportunities.   At the very least, we should show up tonight at the workshop tonight 5-6:30 in SN0014 to share our opinions with the faculty and Director of Undergraduate Studies (regardless of whether you agree with us or not).  Please make your voices heard tonite! Does this mean that the late penalty when we turn in our assignment will be proportionate to 50% divided by approx. 1 month rather than 50% divided by 3 days?   Thanks for the extension btw  Is there any chance we could get an extension\\xa0of the late submission?  Hello. I&#39;m struggling to understand what the last three tests I&#39;m failing from the A6 autograder might be looking for:    Adept Test:\\xa0 reallyFarAwayTest  Jedi Test:\\xa0 unevenJediTest  Jedi Test:\\xa0 onePoolStartsEmpty       As for reallyFarAwayTest, I edited the junit test posted here a few days ago so that one of the the Manhattan distances between the furthest driver&#39;s vehicle and the client&#39;s position was the value Integer.MAX_VALUE and others were very large numbers and passed it fine (albeit it taking about a minute and fifteen seconds to run the test). It didn&#39;t say I had an infinite loop in the autograder, just that I failed it.\\xa0      For unevenJediTest, the junit test posted here actually started with unevenly sized pools and I passed that fine, but I also edited it so that there were some different combinations of uneven pools just in case and passed those as well.      For onePoolStarts empty, I again edited the posted junit test so that this time, one of the pools was passed into the constructor as an element of the list parameter was empty (not null, but an arrayList made from an empty array) and passed the test.      I&#39;m honestly pretty stuck on how to go about debugging it at this point, as my code is passing all of the other tests in the autograder and my own attempts at trying to resolve these three remaining one&#39;s seem are pointing me towards any issues in handling the specific cases they&#39;re named after. I would really appreciate some insight on how to move forward. Thanks!\\xa0      (Also: I&#39;m pretty sure these exact tests have already been posted about, but I&#39;m not certain that a solution has been discovered as to what specifically they might be testing, so I wanted to go ahead and make another post.)  Does anyone know what a ConcurrentModificationException is?   I always return a few names followed by this error when when running the &#34;Eddie Ennion&#34; test code, yet it passes the test fully when I run the &#34;B&#34;,&#34;O&#34;,&#34;B&#34; drivers test code.   I believe my code\\xa0may be getting\\xa0stuck in an eternal while loop I haven&#39;t figured out yet, because I failed every single Jedi test on Gradescope yet still passed a JUnit... it&#39;s quite confusing.      Has anyone else experienced a similar problem/same results?  I feel that the 50% rule is a little unfair. I wasn’t passing 4 of the adept tests because I had a &lt;= somewhere when I should have had a &lt; and that created an endless loop that I did not notice That was my only issue with adept so if the autograder had been available before the due date I would have caught that problem and I would have had 20 more points instead of 10 more.\\xa0      Is there any way that we could get full points\\xa0for something small like that because I worked really hard on A6 and one tiny little mistake keeps me at a 75 instead of an 85.\\xa0 I feel like our grade shouldn&#39;t suffer because the grader wasn&#39;t set up by the due date.  How late after the A6 deadline can we submit for half points?  I cannot pass these tests, but my code runs properly, returns the right values in the right order, terminates once it is done, etc.\\xa0      Does anyone know what could be the problem? I&#39;m out of ideas and hope.\\xa0  Make sure that if you find a driver within the ring that you update everything appropriately if that driver was the last in the pool before returning true  For CodeStyle, do we have unlimited submissions?\\xa0 I accidentally submitted when trying to submit A6 and I doubt that I will get any credit.  For code style, we&#39;re supposed to replace the generic method names (i.e. r(), s()) with the ones in the directions, right? Because when I change the method name, I have to change the JUnit test. So do I leave the names alone or change them and the JUnit tests?  I am passing all the adept tests but this one. Does anyone know what this test is doing because all my J-units are passing so i&#39;m not sure what to change.  What does the below test for:    Adept Test:\\xa0 reallyFarAwayTest  Jedi Test:\\xa0 unevenJediTest  Jedi Test:\\xa0 onePoolStartsEmpty       1.\\xa0 For adept, I tried putting the position at a really high number such as 9999, and it passes my JUnit but not on gradescope.\\xa0      2.\\xa0 For jedi, the previous Piazza JUnit test had uneven pools, and it passes that but it fails the gradescope test.\\xa0      3.\\xa0 Also in jedi, I added &#34;null&#34; in some of the driver pool like\\xa0{null, d0, d2, d1, d3} and it iterates correctly, skipping the null and going to the next pool.\\xa0 Yet again it fails the test on gradescope  I got 17/20 points on my code that i submitted on time. If I resubmit to gradescope to fix the errors, will I get half of the remaining (1.5) or will the rest of my points be graded as late too?  Tried throwing IllegalArgumentException, NoSuchElementException when all of the pools are empty in the constructor, but nothing seems to be accepted in gradescope. What does it want for this test? If I committed and pushed my code for adept and jedi to github, but didn&#39;t technically submit them on gradescope (only submitted my novice portion) will I have points deducted? Should I now resubmit on gradescope with all of my code on github?I opened the autograder after the 6am deadline expecting to see the new tests show up, but they aren&#39;t (Is it only me?). What should I do to get the remaining portion graded? I have not resubmitted, assuming that it will be counted as a late submission (Should I resubmit?). If we come into office hours will the LAs look over our code style assignment and let us know what we would get? I already submitted to gradescope but assuming I can resubmit if the LAs say I should do more.  I am trying to add iterators onto a list for Jedi, but I keep getting a null pointer exception.\\xa0\\xa0      while (bigIter.hasNext() ) { \\t_ListOfIterator.add(bigIter.next().iterator()); }   any tips?  So I signed up for hack 401 and I really want to go, but I have plans for part of that saturday. Is it alright if I attend part of it and not the whole day? Thanks!  Could someone please hint to me why adept isn&#39;t working:      1st: check if nextDriver is not null, if so return true   2nd: while loop creating a temp driver varialbe of iter.next(), checking if tempdrivers manhanttan distance is &gt;= 1 &#43; (count-1)*exp step and &lt;= 1&#43;(count*exp step)   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 if so, next driver = temp driver and true is returned   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 if not then global variable outside = true because driver is out of ring, loop ends   3rd: count incremented by 1   4th: if outside is true, outside = false, reset the iter, return hasNext() to reloop through the drivers at the next ring   5th: else return false      I have been debugging for hours and cant fix it and office hours was very crowded to get the help i need     I am currently working on my A6 Jedi program, and I have gotten a general algorithm to snake through the different iterators. I am using a chain of ifs and else ifs after collecting each Driver to alter the index appropriately, so that each loop around, I can get the right iterator. This is working well, but at some point, for some reason, the program just stops, and I do not get the complete result that I am supposed to get within the test code. The output I get is:   Eddie Ennion  Liliana Pagano  Liliana Pagano  Liliana Pagano  maha Alhomoud  maha Alhomoud  maha Alhomoud  Liliana Pagano  maha Alhomoud  demoniaque something  demoniaque something  demoniaque something      Which is completely correct besides missing the last five drivers.   Is there any obvious reason that this would occur? I feel like I am very close to being done, so having such a small thing happen at the very end of my output is frustrating.      Edit: I realized that I was not processing the empty drivers correctly, so I created a new &#34;streak&#34; integer, that keeps track of how many lists have failed. I then made the algorithm switch to the next index if this one does not work and if streak is less than length. All of the items except for the last one now process correctly. However, I am now getting a nullpointerexception on the very last item, and I do not know why.  if you removed an item from a list at index 1, would the item originally at index 2 now be at index 1? so when you call index 1 after removing the original index 1, would you return the original index 2?  Logically it seems like the proximity limit value passed into the constuctor in Novice shouldn&#39;t be able to negative and the expansion step value passed into the constructor in Adept shougln&#39;t be able to negative or equal to zero, but it&#39;s not specified in the READ ME and the autograder for Novice does not test that the proximity limit value is non-negative. Should we be throwing exceptions in these cases anyway (particularly for Adept whose autograder won&#39;t be released until the assignment deadline)?  Could somebody please give me some pointers for how to approach A6 Jedi&#39;s hasNext()? I&#39;ve been trying to wrap my head around it for the better part the night and can&#39;t seem to get to an answer that makes sense. Thanks!  This was working earlier when I had different code, but now it&#39;s just not starting, and my computer seems to be running harder and being louder :/ I don&#39;t really think I did anything that would cause this. Maybe I have an infinite while loop? I tried to make my code avoid that but I don&#39;t know how to debug so I&#39;m stuck not knowing whether my code works for my tests or not        The assignment doesn&#39;t specify whether our a6 jedi is expected to iterate through driver_pools if one of the Iterable objects are null as apposed to the entire driver_pools list being null. Should we throw an exception for this or let the iterator skip over the empty Iterable? Same for Driver, if there is a single Driver that is null should we skip over it and continue iterating or throw an exception? For A6 Jedi, I created two methods to change the direction of the snake pattern. I found that if the immediate index was 0, I set the direction to be 1, and if the immediate index was the last index, I set the direction to be -1. My void method would physically add the index and direction together, but I can&#39;t seem to figure out how to repeat the last or the first index. Like conceptually, it would go 0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, etc. How do I account for this?  &#34;If after the deadline, your submission does not pass the Adept and Jedi tests, you may resubmit for 50% credit on the points you didn&#39;t already get.&#34;\\xa0      Another Piazza Post had an instructor answer, &#34;Depending on how late the assignments are submitted, late points will be taken off appropriately (ex. submitting 2 min after deadline will take off less than submitting 2 days after the deadline)&#34; The syllabus reads that the maximum penalty is &#34;up to 50%&#34;.\\xa0      The reason I ask is I waited for over an hour for office hours but they closed before I got a turn, so I would ideally like to go into office hours the afternoon of the due date to get\\xa0help and some more credit.\\xa0  When I run the tests KMP provided for novice on Eclipse, I am passing all of them. However, on gradescope, I am only getting 4 out of 20 points. I have already staged and pushed the changes before resubmitting. I am not sure why I am not getting all of the points?         My tests stopped running all of a sudden and they look like this. There is no failure trace, and it seems to be stuck on Adept because when I run Novice and Jedi individually, they work. Has anyone else ran into this problem/have any suggestions? I&#39;ve already tried deleting the Adept test and remaking it and it still doesn&#39;t work.\\xa0  I am working on my A6 adept code, and when I try to reinitialize my iterator field with a new version of the iterator, I get an endless loop of &#34;demoniaque something&#34; after the first two items. I know reinitializing this iterator is a requirement in order for this code to work, unless I am missing something. It seems like in order to make this code scalable to any number of iterations of the code, it needs to be able to do this. When I create an &#34;iterator&#34; and &#34;iterator2&#34; and have the code within hasNext use the iterator2 instead of reinitializing the first one, the code functions as expected, with only one demonique. However, I obviously cannot make infinite new iterators within the constructor.   Am I missing something obvious? Do any of you have a suggestion on what to play with to keep the loop from activating infinitely? I am completely stumped.      Edit: I have been testing more things, and here&#39;s another fact I have found.   If I set iterator equal to iterator2, it will work without creating an infinite loop. However, since iterators are objects and not primitive values, I cannot repeat this more than once since iterating through this iterator again alters iterator2, making this equally as effective as if I had just iterated through a second iterator. Whenever I try to create a new iterator and assign it to my iterator field, that&#39;s when it repeats the same name infinitely.      Edit: I found a workaround, but the problem still doesn&#39;t make sense to me. I decided to make an array of iterators, and initialize them all, and then swap them out whenever I needed a new iterator. It works, but I am still curious as to why this was an issue in the first place.  For A6&#39;s SnakeOrderAcrossPools Iterator, I know we should throw an exception if the driver_pools list is null. However, should we also throw an exception if an element within the driver_pools list is null?  I don&#39;t understand the point of this test.  The driver_pool is an object that can be modified outside of this class.     For jedi I am trying to encapsulate a list of driver iterators to access throughout the code.\\xa0 the list is called &#39;allIters&#39;. In the constructor, I run a for loop to create &#39;allIters&#39;:      for (int i = 0; i &lt; driver_pools.size(); i&#43;&#43;) {   \\xa0// here I create an iterator for the element at index i called &#39;thisIter&#39; then use .add:   allIters.add(thisIter);      }      when I run my JUnit tests my code consistently fails here. Anyone have any other methods to add elements to the List of driver iterators in the constructor?  I&#39;m testing my Novice in Gradescope and only getting 2 points, but when I test it in Eclipse with the J Unit tests KMP sent out, I&#39;m passing all the tests. Does anyone have any idea where the disconnect could be? Thanks!  Why is it showing:\\xa0    NullPositionConstructorTest  NullPoolConstructorExceptionTest       I&#39;ve tried throwing NullPointerExceptions for if the driver_pool is null and if client_position is null but it doesn&#39;t fix the error  I know the adept and jedi tests will be released after the deadline, will the grader for adept and jedi be released soon?\\xa0  In the constructor do we need check if the expansion step is greater than zero, or is it equally valid if the expansion step is zero?         Should the line that says &#34;fail(&#34;Should have thrown IllegalArgumentException&#34;);&#34; be in the catch statement right below it? Because the way it is written now, no matter what happens in the code, the test is going to fail.  How can we get 20 points if maximum is only 10?         When I submitted my code to the autograder, this message came up:       Does anyone know why this problem is coming up?  I tried to submit my assignment on gradescope I am getting an error that says:\\xa0   &#34;The autograder failed to execute correctly. Contact your course staff for help in debugging this issue. Make sure to include a link to this page so that they can help you most effectively.&#34;\\xa0   Does anyone know what may be going wrong? Thanks!  for the adept test, I am getting   Eddie Ennion (correct)   Liliana Pagano (correct)   demoniaque something (correct)   demoniaque something   demoniaque something      can anyone suggest what may be causing this repeat? I tried tweaking my hasNext code a few times, but ended up just messing up the first three correct ones.  Do we need to comment the Deck/DeckImpl in the code style assignment since a description Deck is not included in the assignment&#39;s Read Me? If so, what&#39;s the best way to go about doing so? I personally don&#39;t know much about poker so I was using the Read Me in order to include comments that weren&#39;t simply restating what the code was doing on a literal level, but I don&#39;t really understand what Deck is is abstracting without additional description.\\xa0      Thanks!  In adept, I coded two while loops that are nested within one main loop. One checks for drivers that meet the conditions for the first ring, and the second looks for drivers beyond the first ring, but fall within the (1 &#43; (n * expansion_step)) condition. I&#39;ve ran the debugger, and the problem seems to be that because I create a new iterator of the driver pool each time I return true in these loops, my code never gets past the first ring.\\xa0      I&#39;m not sure how to approach this issue, does anyone have any pointers/tips on this? Any help is appreciated -- thank you!!  What I did was create a new Iterable&lt;Driver&gt; that&#39;s a copy of driver_pool and make an ArrayList of Drivers. Then I used the forEach method and did ArrayList::add for each Driver in the Iterable. Then I called a list.size() method to find the size of the pool. Is that what yall are doing or is there another way KMP wants us to find the size?      List&lt;Driver&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;Driver&gt;(); Iterable&lt;Driver&gt; _iterable_pool_size = _driver_pool;  _iterable_pool_size.forEach(list::add); _pool_size = list.size();     my eclipse wont open, everytime i try to open up my workspace it gives me a pop-up saying: An error has occurred. See the log file C:\\\\Users\\\\brian\\\\eclipse-workspace\\\\.metadata\\\\.log      does anyone know how to fix this? im scared that i will lose all my data, including the ones from a6 if i tried to reinstall eclipse  I have my SnakeOrderAcrossPoolsIterator working until a pool is reached with no more drivers in it, where it throws a Null Pointer Exception.\\xa0 How would I &#34;skip&#34; over the pools with no more drivers so that this exception is not thrown?      Thank you!  If a list only has 4 driver collections and we set an variable to the 4th index of the list, would that variable be null?      ex.    Iterator&lt;Driver&gt; driverCollection = driver_pools.get(j).iterator();     Where j = 4. Would driverCollection equal to null given that there is only 4 driverpools and none at the fourth index?\\xa0  I encapsulated an iterable&lt;Driver&gt; object and an Iterator&lt;Driver&gt; object. In the ExpandingProximityIterator, I set the Iterator object to the iterable iterator() method, example: iterator = driverIterator.iterator().      In my hasNext() method I can go through the set of drivers that are &lt;= 1 but going into the next ring I simply do iterator = driverIterator.iterator() and it will iterate through the list of drivers up to a certain point and then start from the beginning all over again rather than continue on with the list. For example, if driver 2 and driver 4 meet the condition, it will iterate through driver 1, driver 2, and then start back at driver 1 again rather than going to driver 3 and on.. etc.      However, if I create a second iterator in ExpandingProximityIterator (iterator2 = driverIterator.iterator()), it will iterate just fine, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s going to help with finding drivers in the increasing ring requirements.      Any clues on what could be causing this? I&#39;m stuck on this part.  For ExpandingProximityIterator, I am getting:      Eddie Ennion      Liliana Pagano      Yazid Alamry      demoniaque something      Yazid Alamry      Yazid Alamry      maha Alhomoud      Yazid Alamry      I know that this is happening because in between each expansion, hasNext() is true so it is printing out &#34;Yazid Alamry.&#34; Does anyone know how to move to the next expansion without returning true for hasNext()?  I have figured out how to snake through the pools in increasing order, but I can&#39;t figure out how to snake backwards through the pools once it reaches the last pool.\\xa0 Can any point me in the right direction for where I should go? Thanks!  Will we be allowed to see our grade and resubmit the code style assignment multiple times?  Can someone explain how to\\xa0put the Junit tests into eclipse? I&#39;m having trouble getting them to run and i don&#39;t know if I&#39;m doing something completely wrong - I made sure to add the junit test to the classpath and made sure the a6 project is linked to it as well. any help would be appreciated! also big thank you to the people who\\xa0shared their junit test code on piazza!  First, when will our midterm be graded to completion? The last section is still not graded. Also, a6 has still not been posted on Gradescope. Will there be an extension?\\xa0      Lastly, for the code grading assignment, I thought we were supposed to go into office hours to have it graded but nothing has been said about this.\\xa0      I would really appreciate it if one of the TAs could address these questions :) Thank you!  There is an entry for code style on gradescope, but when I tried to upload my code, it says there is no autograder configured. Is this a problem with my computer or is there just no autograder yet (which would be fine, I just want to make sure gradescope works for me)?  I was just starting on the Code Style project, and\\xa0 the constructor you provide is &#34;public CardImpl(int rank, Card.Suit suite)&#34;      Is it supposed to be suit or suite? Thanks for the help.  In essence, how is ProximityIterator even used if it were to be used in some program? I&#39;m confused on how an Iterator class works overall, but mostly understand how iterators on their own are used.  Did anyone get additional ten points for their midterm grade. Our professor said he hasn&#39;t put them in yet, but did anyone get their additional ten points yet. I&#39;m not sure if I got mine  Since the A6 will due the next Tuesday, when will the grader be released? Thanks! Appreciate it!  I am struggling with trying to figure out how to implement the methods and how to iterate through\\xa0the pool multiple times while changing the size. Can anyone give a push in the right direction?  Is the example code used to help us get started on A6 posted anywhere online? I don&#39;t see it in the lecture 14 example code repository. If it&#39;s not, is there any way it could be posted because I was not able to write it all down in class. Thanks!  What if there was a computer science-themed karaoke at the 401 Hackathon?! That would be a fun event to add to the current events that they are planning.\\xa0         *This idea is not associated with Shannon&#39;s karaoke idea, at all.  Here are JUnit tests I made for A6. They are a bit rough but I think they work.       novice.java     adept.java     jedi.java   Hi,   I am working on adept and have not had any issues, but when I put in the test code I am only getting this:      Eddie Ennion      Liliana Pagano      demoniaque something      Yazid Alamry      when it should be:   Eddie Ennion      Liliana Pagano      demoniaque something      Yazid Alamry      maha Alhomoud      I&#39;m not too sure what I am doing wrong but if anyone has any clue about why its cutting off I would love some advice!  Are we supposed to write comments for any methods or implementations in A6?  Hi,    I&#39;m working through the code styling assignment right now and have two questions.      The first is if we are allowed to change method names. I see an obvious getter that is misnamed, but if i change the method name then it will fail the JUnit test? Does this mean that I should change the name or just leave it alone so that it passes the test.      The second is if we are supposed to reimplement the code too. There are some things that I would have implemented differently / put in different places. Are we supposed to reimplement the methods or assume that their current implementation is acceptable since it technically passes the JUnit tests?      Thanks!  I have been working on A6 locally and now when I try to clone the git repository in eclipse I am getting a transport error. For possible reasons, it tells me invalid URL or no internet connection, when neither is the case. Does anybody know any possible solutions?  How do we reset the iterations every time we check for a particular case ring?   I am trying to go for the second approach so I created a method that returns the size of our Iterable&lt;Driver&gt; and created a global variable to keep the count of drivers.\\xa0      Any ideas?  Can someone explain what we are trying to find in adept? What is the expansion step?do we need to use the void remove() method?           Hey,   When is the submission link for assignment 6 going to be up?\\xa0        Probably a dumb question but where/how do we submit the code style assignment?\\xa0  Here is my test package for A6      extract the package to your src file and run the test_class code      https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jtXmwIWdYs1pDSRI2nOPj4bjqT64lRc9/view?usp=sharing      It&#39;s something until the autograder is up    Do we use the iterator that KMP suggests in the &#34;Tips&#34; section as a way to iterate through drivers in Novice, or should we use a for-each loop and use the iterator for something else?      Just confused on how to use the iterator instance variable that KMP recommends...  Can anyone tell me what is the criteria for selecting an available\\xa0driver in Jedi? I don&#39;t know what is the rule we need to use to select the driver? \\xa0Is that still the same as the Adept or Novice which requires the available driver must greater than or smaller than a proximity value?\\xa0  During class I thought I understood KMP&#39;s code, but I&#39;m confused now, and unfortunately I didn&#39;t think to write it down. Is there anyway I can access it?  Just wanted to clarify something from last thursday&#39;s lecture. In the code KMP showed us to explain the project, I have written down that the code which has the boundaries for filtering out the iterator for different values (like how the distance has to equal the client position in A1) in the hasNext() method. I wanted to make sure this was correct and I didn&#39;t write my notes wrong.      \\xa0  I&#39;m confused about this instance field: &#34;Use an instance field to store the next driver that matches the proximity limit. Initialize this to null in your constructor&#34;      Does this mean we need to declare\\xa0the field as an iterable to store all of the values that match the proximity limit?\\xa0  When will A6 be set up in gradescope?   Are we going to have JUnit Test for this assignment?  Should we submit a regrade request on Gradescope and also send an email with reasons to KMP?  T/F: The class Object has an is-a relationship with all other classes   Why is this false?  Will we have any points off if we only attend 9/12 of the recitation?  http://java-x.blogspot.com/2007/01/implementing-decorator-pattern-in-java.html  Where/When will we be notified if a recitation is optional? Like is the recitation tomorrow optional? Where do we go for updates?  What&#39;s the situation regarding quizzes? We&#39;ve only had three, and I have a 0/3 for one of them as do many other people. Even though it is only 10% of the grade, I feel like it will still drag my grade down since there have been so few. Will there be more in the future? Will any of them be dropped?\\xa0  Version D:   In the code writing section, Person Class, I used the &#34;protected&#34; keyword for fields and lost a point.\\xa0   My classmates told me they did not lose points for this.   Could I get\\xa0the point back?  \\xa01.17. The == operator in Java will test if two string objects represent the same sequence of characters. &#34;False&#34;           Just as the execute result and the slides above show, in Java &#34;==&#34; will test if two string objects represent the same sequence of characters, but we should not do so. However, in 1.17, the question is whether &#34;The == operator in Java will test\\xa0if two string objects represent the same sequence of characters&#34;, so the &#34;false&#34; answer is a little bit weird since it actually will do so.\\xa0  Form A   True/False 1.18:   The question reads &#34;If interB is a subclass of interA, then any object that implements interB must implement interA.&#34;\\xa0      The correct answer was true but I said that this was false, my reasoning being that classes/objects cannot implement other classes, they can only extend other classes, therefore it is impossible for an object to implement interB, which is a class. Is this one true because it is technically vacuously true, or should it be false?      I found an instance when a statement that was vacuously true was not marked as true by the grader, part III code Comprehension Question 3.3 line C:   There was an option: &#34;If the call to the constructor is not allowed, the error is discovered when the program is compiled&#34;. The premise is false because the call to the constructor is allowed (that was the correct answer), thus this statement is vacuously true, however this statement was not marked as true in the grading.      Therefore there is a contradiction on whether vacuously true statements, which are if then statements where the premise is false, are considered true or false by the grader.      For example if a True/False question is &#34;If 1 &#43; 1 = 3 then all dogs can fly&#34;, should this be true because it is vacuously true or should it be false because the premise is false?              Hello,   I was wondering if anyone else still has their quiz grade for 10/3 as 0/3 points? I did take the quiz and sakai shows that I submitted it but I still have 0 points. Thanks!  True/False:      Methods in Java are always virtual --&gt; shouldn&#39;t this be False because we learned that virtualness can be turned off with the super keyword implying that methods in java are not &#39;always&#39; virtual.\\xa0      The class Object has an is-a relationship with all other classes --&gt; shouldn&#39;t this be true because Object is a parent class of all classes, and therefore there is an is-a relationship.\\xa0  I thought our Gradescope grades were going to be published yesterday?

The error log shows that none of the commands in eclipse.ini are being run properly. Has anyone else had this issue?  Today when I opened my\\xa0mac, eclipse was gone. I couldn&#39;t find it in applications. I of course still have the .dmg file but is the only way to get it back to install it again? Is there any way to recover it the way it was with all the packages/code I had already imported.\\xa0      \\xa0  Are we required to write the codes of iterators by ourselves (like lec12.ex2 did)? Or, could we just use object.iterator() and for-each loop?  Are we gonna have our scores curved and when should we expect to have our solid grades for this exam? I&#39;m still deciding on the pass/fail thing but I feel like without the solid score I&#39;m hesitating.  For some reason I never got my grade back on the midterm in Gradescope. Is there a reason for this?  Say I got a 70/90 = 77.77% on the midterm and 8/10 on the last problem.\\xa0      Is my final midterm grade 78/100 = 78% or 78/90 = 86.6% ?  It isn&#39;t on the syllabus  Did anyone get their midterm grade back yet? I am too scared to look I just wanna see if anyone else got theirs back  When I submitted my code with changes to my Roll class for Jedi, GradeScope failed the tests for Adept that would be affected by those changes but passed the tests for Jedi. Is this normal, or am I doing something incorrectly?  At the time of the normal deadline, I had all but 2 tests passed. I attempted to fix my code now but I&#39;m still getting everything but the last two jedi seaweed tests.      Will I still get points off based on the Late Submission policy even if there is no difference in the test cases passed between the normal deadline and the late deadline? Approx time when midterm grades will be released? I&#39;ve been working on A5 Jedi for a long time and for some reason I keep failing all the tests in the auto grader. I&#39;ve tested out my code using my own tests and everything runs fine, so I don&#39;t understand what is going wrong. Any tips?   What should I do?  I&#39;ve been stuck on the same 2 Jedi errors since the morning and have tried both Arraylist and Hashmaps for this but still have the same error (on the same line too) (     Jedi Test: testAddEnoughSeaweedIfNot (0.0/0.67) \\xa0(A5JediTests.line87)   Jedi Test: testAddSeaweedIfNot (0.0/0.67) \\xa0(A5JediTests.line61)       I basically create an arraylist and use the combine method.

For A5 adept, how are the classes we need to implement (sashimi, nigiri, and roll) supposed to retrieve the info needed to implement their methods?  I&#39;m using nested for loops and arraylists to check for duplicates. If there is a duplicate, I take out the duplicated ingredient out of my list and add the combined version in. At the end, I add every ingredient in the list to the original array, but am failing the Jedi test for it. Any advice?  Also, all the test in Gradescope for Roll class passed.   Does anyone know how to deal with the situation? It&#39;s weird because\\xa0A5\\xa0Junit tests in Eclipse pass.     I am working on eliminating duplicates in the array. I&#39;m using a double for loop to compare all of the elements within the\\xa0cloned array with itself. I&#39;ve created an ArrayList to store my non-repeated and combined ingredients. Inside the double for loops, I am using the remove and add methods to combine duplicates into\\xa0the ArrayList. The code seems to be right when going through it in my head but it is not passing in Gradescope and I am not sure how to approach debugging it.      Any help would be much appreciated!! Thank you!  How long after the due date are late assignments able to be submitted? What is the late policy for grading?\\xa0  Hello,   For Novice, I have passed all of my tests but testRice() will not pass and I believe that my super statement is correct as it has worked for the rest of my ingredients. Also, testBadCombine() does not work but I used an IllegalArgumentException if !other.getIngredient().equals(this.getIngredient());   Does anyone have an idea as to what the problem might be? Thank you!  When will A6 be posted? I&#39;d love to work on that during fall break. Thanks! Appreciate it!  How do you get e) d.m(2.0) = 9? Also how do you know when you can stop and have your answer?    So, I understand that IngredientPortionImpl is the parent class of each IngredientPortion (AvocadoPortion(), CrabPortion(), etc.) like IngredientImpl is the parent class for each of the ingredients (Avocado(), Crab(), etc.).   However, is IngredientPortionImpl supposed to be a subclass of IngredientImpl???   If not, is IngredientPortionImpl only supposed to encapsulate an Ingredient in it?      I&#39;ve written all the code for the portion aspect of Novice but the grader won&#39;t pass the tests...  Will there be an option to retake the exam if we did not do well?

So when you call m1 in class See, it will result in\\xa0   m2(2,3) - m2(1,1)   From there we will call m2 in class Bee, which will call super for m2(2,3) and goes to class Aye. Then, m2(1,1) will go to m1 in class Bee, unless I am mistaken. Doing what I did, it got me 3 - 2. Since this is not correct, I am unclear whether the m2(1,1) will go back to class See or go to Aye. I tried both ways and still didn&#39;t get -2 as the answer.\\xa0 In the 2014 midterm 2, there&#39;s a question in part 3 that asks you to what the value of  ((Doh) r).m(“Brooks”) is. This was able to compile and the answer was 4. However, in the 2018 fall midterm there&#39;s a similar question in part 3 that asks you what the value of ((Bee) d).m2(1, 2, 3) is but the answer was that this would not compile. I thought it would compile and get a valid result based on the answer from the 2014 midterm. Can someone explain why this is? I try to do it step by step and I got 11 as answer.

According to the java tutorial of Oracle, the method signature of a method includes a method&#39;s name and its parameter list. But In the #4 of 2014 Midterm 1, the statement that&#34;the method signature indicates the return type of the method&#34; is true. So what is exactly the definition of   Method Signature  ? Thanks! are switch statements going to be tested on the midterm? The question reads:      F 8. A variable can be assigned the result of any expression.      Can you explain why this is a false statement? Is this statement referring to a specific variable, so only results that are of the same type can be assigned? If you were to interpret it as &#34;The result of any expression be assigned to a variable,&#34; then would it be True?  what does the statement\\xa0   &#34;A derived property is computed as a function of an object&#39;s state.&#34;   mean exactly?

Hi! I have almost figured out how to solve the foo problem but I&#39;m having trouble understanding why foo(2) works and foo(3) does not work.   Copied Directly From a lecture slide:           •\\xa0 The body of a method is a sequence of statements.   •\\xa0\\xa0A statement ends in a semi colon   –\\xa0 Types of statements: •\\xa0 Declarations of local variables   \\xa0•\\xa0 Assignment •\\xa0 Conditonal •\\xa0 Loop •\\xa0 Method call •\\xa0 Return statement      My question is how is a condition a type of statement if an &#39;IF&#39; statement is formatted as such:   if (condition) {    //statements in here   }      But the if-statement itself does not end in a semicolon? Does it mean that it is a statement because the body of a conditional is composed of statements?              Was this done on purpose, is it a bug on my end, or is that just the way the points work out? This isn&#39;t really that important of a question I was just curious.  16) What is the value of the variable “result” after the code below executes? Answer: _____60_____   int[] a = new int[] {10, 20, 30};   int[] b = new int[] {2, 1, 0};   int[] c = a;   int[] d = b;   c[0] = d[2];   a[1] = c[d[b[2]]];   int result = a[0] &#43; a[1] &#43; a[2];      I am consistently getting 70?  1.   c) A subclass can change the access modifier of a parent class field by redeclaring the field   The answer is false   I tried to declare a protected field in the parent and redeclare it as a public field in the child, but the eclipse can still compile. What&#39;s my mistake...?      b) Two subclasses with a common parent class have direct access to each other&#39;s public fields   The answer is true   I tried on IDE and found that the siblings cannot access a public field of the other unless the public field is also static. However, a public static field can also be accessed anywhere by calling the class name. Did I misinterpret the question?      4.\\xa0   d) Encapsulated objects of a composition will also be compositions   I know this is false but cannot find a\\xa0specific example... Thank you in advance for helping me out!     Can we treat the types of sushi as Strings? If not, then how should we access the Ingredient associated with the specific type? Thanks!   No worries. I have used toString() to find the name and passed the tests.  In this practice test, question 12 said that AVar_ is a valid variable name. But KMP said that we should not use capital letters at the beginning of variable name. So I&#39;m confused.  Will the midterm structured similarly to former practice exams?         Why is this true? If we declare the variable to be public we can access it anywhere.\\xa0           * c) A return statement in a method ends the execution of the method.   \\xa0   This option is mak as true.\\xa0   \\xa0   If the method is void then it will not have a return statement?   what do you guys think? I think it is not specific to what the method type is and it should so I considered it FALSE.      I&#39;ve been trying for a long time to do the duplicates, but I&#39;m very stuck (I&#39;m using ArrayLists). Currently I&#39;m using a double for loop to try and find the duplicates, but for some reason, it won&#39;t work. Any tips?     //When\\xa0a\\xa0method\\xa0(call\\xa0it\\t \\xa0method\\t \\xa0A) is called from within another method //(call it method B), the code within method A can access local variables within method B  //at the point where the call to method A was made.\\t   public static void scopeOne() {      String myName = &#34;name&#34;;     scopeTwo(myName); }  public static void scopeTwo(String myName) {      System.out.println(myName); }     I think the statement is true and here is my example.      Please point out my mistakes!  My reciatation leader said today that an object&#39;s type and which methods it has access to is defined by what implementation it is. For example, in Sandwich sandwich = new GrilledCheese();, the type and therefore what methods it has access to would be GrilledCheese. GrilledCheese here being a class that implements the Sandwich interface.  I thought it was the opposite. I thought the type of a reference variable is defined to the left of the variable name. Isn&#39;t that the point of polymorphism? Regardless of specific implementation, we can change the type of the variable and its method scope to fit our needs.Can we please get the answers to the last quiz we took? Also, Katherine said they are probably for attendance only, but maybe not. Can someone confirm? whats the website that he showed us in class that makes environment diagrams as it loops through code?  True/False &#34;A specific array can hold values of any type&#34;: False      is it false because the values must be of the same type? or are there some values that arrays cannot hold at all?  Really trying to go home early today. How many absences do we have without repercussions?  It&#39;s more like a question about program design.   In A5, If we want an\\xa0avocado, we can do this instead of creating a new class:   Ingredient avocado = new IngredientImpl(&#34;avocado&#34;, 0.24, 42, true, false, false)   Apparently, we just need one type of avocado in this case. We will not have different instances of Avocado, such as  Avocado a, Avocado b.    So why we need to create so many classes?     Should we be doing only the Midterm 1s? Or should we be practicing both Midterms 1 and 2?  If you copied the sashimi enum from the assignment instructions, make sure you change YELLOwTAIL to YELLOWTAIL.  #14 on the Spring 2013 midterm says:  Which of the following statements is true of objects? a) Every object is associated with a class. b) Every object is associated with at least one interface. c) Two object references that have the same value refer to the same object. d) The state of an object is determined by the current values of its instance fields. e) A new copy of an object is created when it is passed to a method as a parameter.  The answer key says that a, c, and d are correct. I understand why d is correct, but not a and c.      For a, it is my understanding that\\xa0 not  every object is associated with a class, since objects can be associated with interfaces. For example,\\xa0 List&lt;String&gt; list\\xa0 is an object but is not associated with a class until it is instantiated as a type of list. Instead, it is associated with an interface.      For c, say you declare two arrays  int[] arr1 = {1, 2, 3}  and  int[] arr2 = {1, 2, 3} . Even though both arrays contain the same values, each reference points to a different location in memory, which means they are  not  referring to the same object, correct?      If someone could point out errors in my logic or provide an explanation for why answer choices a and c are considered true, it would be extremely helpful.     One of the practice exams has various questions on subinterfaces, I don&#39;t recall learning about subinterfaces. If we did cover subinterfaces and my memory is failing\\xa0me can someone tell me which powerpoint it is in.  are we allowed to listen to music during the midterm?

I am confused by this instruction:\\xa0The\\xa0 Ingredient\\xa0 associated with each of these classes should be an instance of the corresponding ingredient class (i.e.,\\xa0 AvocadoPortion \\xa0should use an instance of\\xa0 Avocado \\xa0as its ingredient).      Can anyone explain this? Thanks so much!  As confirmed with KMP, you do NOT need a scantron for the midterm.  Im failing both gradescope tests for seaweed in jedi. In my own test code, I called one roll without enough seaweed and one with enough seaweed, and my code ran how it was supposed to (supplied .1 to the one without enough and left the other one alone). Any ideas?      Update: fixing getCalories() solved the issue. thanks so much!  Anyone who came to office hours today around 12-1pm, someone left a black bag with an iclicker in here  How do we set up the method in the Sushi implementations for getIngredients()? I&#39;m unsure what is supposed to go into the array of IngredientPortions and how we are supposed to do that. Will it only be one or two things in the array based on what the kind of shushi has as ingredients?      Update: I realized that you have to use switch(type) and then cases for each of the possible enumerations.  My IngredientPortions (AvocadoPortion, SeaweedPortion, etc) are all failing in the autograder. However, I&#39;ve run them through my own tests and insured outputs are as they should be. I&#39;m trowing exceptions as well. I can&#39;t see anything in the instructions that I haven&#39;t accounted for either. What could be causing this?  I&#39;d like to attempt all the exams without answers  I got the correct answer in my own JUnit test, but fail in gradescope. I think the problem is with the number of decimals of the result. For example, I got 1.25999999 instead of 1.26. Does any one has any suggestions for this problem? I put my code into grade scope and everything works except for this test. I have tried everything and I do not understand why testBadCombine isn&#39;t working. I have a runtime exception listed and it should work. If anyone has any advice or suggestions that would be great!   UPDATE: Ok, there is no problem with the autograder.   TL;DR This question\\xa0is not likely going to help you.   Original question:    Adept is\\xa0having a clone test for Roll class&#39;\\xa0IngredientPortion\\xa0array and Jedi wants me to combine the same ingredients and add seaweed if it doesn&#39;t exist, which would result in something which is not a clone.  I have\\xa0been able to combine the same ingredients and add seaweed if needed, but in that case,\\xa0I think there is no need for cloning. Nevertheless, even in this case I am returning a cloned array and taking the clone of the array\\xa0given\\xa0to the constructor before working on deciding the values of my internal IngredientPortion array.    I am getting only the Roll class stuff wrong on the Autograder.    If someone has been able to get everything right, then please let me know that there is nothing wrong with the autograder, so that I can\\xa0devote more time to my Roll class.  Under Part III: Overriding and Overloading,\\xa0b) c.m1(1, 2, 3) says its answer is -2. Can someone explain the path to finding it&#39;s -2? I understood the answer for all of the other ones, but keep end up getting 1 for this one and I can&#39;t figure it out.    Is there any way that assignment 5 can be due on the 16th at 6 am instead of the 15th at 6 am, so that if there are some people that haven&#39;t finished the assignment, they&#39;re not stressed over studying for the midterm and finishing the assignment?\\xa0           When will the junit test be posted for A5??

Looking at a question from a previous midterm:            A parent class has direct access to protected fields within a subclass.      The correct answer is false. Can someone explain what the question is even asking? I would guess false because im not sure what is being stated.        I am wondering if I get 9/10 points before the due date while I get to pass all the Junit tests after the due date and before the late due date. Do I need to resubmit it? How will\\xa0my scores be calculated?  Question from a past exam:      Which of these statements properly declares a named constant?   a) static final public int A_CONSTANT = 3;   e) static final public int A_CONSTANT;      According to the answer key, A is correct while E is wrong. When I tested around, i found that you can declare a final variable and give it a value later. So why is E wrong; you have declared a constant, you just havent assigned it a value?  Whenever I run my code through the JUnit tests in Eclipse, it passes, but as soon as I submit it to gradescope it fails every single test. Does anyone know how I can go about fixing this error?  which lecture # will the midterm material go through? 1 through 11 or further than 11?  When will the j unit test be available for a5. I&#39;m sure a lot of us are trying to finish this assignment rather soon so that we can focus studying for the exam.\\xa0  I created an implementation of Ingredient called IngredientImpl which takes name, price per oz, and cals per oz as inputs. then I have subclasses (using extends IngredientImpl) for each of the ingredients. I have them as public Avocado() like the instructions say to. But, when I try to create an Avocado object for example, it says it&#39;s not visible. Why can&#39;t I access the class Avocado?  If the total sum of seaweed doesn&#39;t amount to 0.1 ounces, are we supposed to add a portion of seaweed to top off the amount to 0.1 (e.g. if there&#39;s a total of 0.05 ounces of seaweed, add a new SeaweedPortion of 0.05 ounces) or strictly add a new SeaweedPortion of 0.1 ounces?  I know it is OK to say &#39;inherit a class&#39;. But maybe it is better to &#39;implement an interface&#39;?  When will the JUnit Test be available for A5? Did anyone else mistakingly think the quiz today was for completion like the last two? RIP Is there any way to see the correct answers for the quiz we had today to help for the midterm?  KMP said the quiz will give at least 1 point but I have a 0/3. What is up with that? Does it actually count towards the grade?  Will Assignment 5 be graded on style, comments, etc.?  For number 5 on the fall 2018 midterm that is a true or false question and it says the answer is true. Can anyone help me understand what this question is asking and why it is true?  5.

However, for each of these, I am creating a MutablePixelArrayPicture, painting it with the Paint method, then returning the same Mutable object. Also, the paintOnePixel() test passes on my MutablePixelArrayPicture class. Does anyone know how this error could be occuring?

When we call a paint method, we&#39;ll change a pixel or a rectangle/square to the according pixel. After this is done, do we need to blend the unchanged pixels to blend with the new pixel(s) or is the paint method just changing the pixel and not blending anything after?  is anyone seeing the lecture 10 slides on sakai? or is it just me?  how do you do a4 gradient without creating a new array (like in monochrome)?  I can&#39;t seem to locate directions for the paintOnePixel method. Am I missing something in the ReadMe file?\\xa0      EDIT: This is with regards to the horizontal and vertical stack classes. Sorry about the confusion.   EDIT2: Nevermind, I just read the autograder results wrong. Whoops.  I&#39;m not positive if I&#39;m doing this method properly      my implementation looks like this for horizontal:      if x is greater than the (left pictures width-1), then rightpic = rightpic.paint(x,y,p) to account for immutable and mutable types, else leftpic = leftpic.paint(x,y,p), and then the this object is returned      What is wrong with this logic?      Also can I assume that for the rectangle and circle paint methods that they can paint both left/right and top/bottom paintings?  I am getting errors for Adept Tests 14-18. They stop when checking for component equality. I was wondering if anyone else had these issues and what they did to resolve them? I am\\xa0unsure if there is something wrong with my blending?? I have tried setting the blending as a new pixel and then setting my array[i][j] to the new pixel? If someone could enlighten me, I&#39;d appreciate it! What is the difference between an error and failure in JUnit? Is an error something that will cause autograder to mark something as wrong?

Gradescope error:      Screen_Shot_20190930_at_8.47.39_PM.png      Screen_Shot_20190930_at_8.47.34_PM.png       After wiping my A4 from eclipse/my computer still didn&#39;t work, as a last attempt I left the repository for A4, thinking that I could get access to it again from the link in the email. Now, when I click on the link to access\\xa0the A4 assignment from the Sakai link or email link, I get a 404 Error Message.      Please let me know ASAP what I can do to be able to recommit to A4 and turn it into gradescope!         Thank you!  I know this should be mutable so I should be returning vertical or horizontal. However, the only constructor I have for them is one that needs two parts. How would I go about doing this?  I still can&#39;t see my implementations in git staging. I literally can&#39;t submit to gradescope if I don&#39;t figure it out, so help would be appreciated.  I am having trouble with coming up with a way to paint a specific rectangle within the given array. I have tried calculating the distances of (ax,ay) and (bx,by) to (0,0), but that did not seem to work. Am I going in the right direction? Thanks.      EDIT: Thank you! This worked!\\xa0  I am having the same problem with paint one pixel in all of the adept picture classes as other people on here have.\\xa0 The thing that has been referred to several times as the source of the error is referring/tying the new created picture to the original source, so when the new object is changed, so is the source. In my paint methods, I am creating new objects to pass the picture through the mutable pixel array class like so:   Picture pic = new MutablePixelArrayPicture(pixel_array);   I have also tried creating a new pixel array, feeding my values into that pixel array and initializing the new object with\\xa0 that  but still no cigar.\\xa0 (I also have all of my main class variables in the Horizontal, Vertical, Immutable, Gradient classes set as private final.)  This is the line of code in my test case that is failing.      When I added the null pointer exception, all the Adept Test Case failed. I&#39;m confused because for a vertical stack picture, shouldn&#39;t the Top and Bottom have the same *width,* not height???      Picture invalidVerticalStackPictureNullValueRight = new VerticalStackPicture(redImmutablePicture, \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tyellowGradientPicture); \\t\\tfail(&#34;Left and right are not the same height.&#34;); \\t\\t} catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {  \\t\\t}         Here is the test that I am failing.      My method goes something similar to creating a pixel (p1) equal to blending the upper_left with the lower_left with a factor of y/height, then creating another pixel (p2) equal to blending the upper_right with the lower_right with a factor of y/height, then blending p1 with p2 by a factor of x/width, the factors were all cast to doubles too.      Any info is appreciated  I keep getting 2.7513 when the grader expects .2. I am using the formula :             new = Math.pow(old, (1.0/gamma));      I casted the whole thing to a double so it would pass the other tests. As far as I can tell, the pixel being passed into Gamma is a ColorPixel(0.2, 0.3, 0.25); Any tips?     I am stuck on the Novice test that tests for IllegalArgumentExceptions within the mutable pixel array constructor, specifically the one that tests for null columns. Can anyone please point me in the right direction to checking for null columns? Thank you!!   Hi! I was running the JUnit tests for my A4 Novice code but it keeps getting stuck on the testPartialOverlapPaintCircle(). Is there anyway I can fix this? It won&#39;t go through the rests of the tests because of this.      Edit: never mind, I figured it out!  My code for this is only one line that&#39;s the return statement. I&#39;m not sure if I need more, but I think one line can fit in everything you need.   The junit test is failing on line 123 (bolded area)   Picture source =  new MonochromePicture(5, 5, new GrayPixel(0.25)); \\t\\tsource = source.paint(0, 0, 1, 1, new GrayPixel(0.75)); \\t\\tPixelTransformation thresh050 = new Threshold(0.5); \\t\\tPicture xformed_picture = new TransformedPicture(source, thresh050); \\t\\tassertEquals(source.getWidth(), xformed_picture.getWidth()); \\t\\tassertEquals(source.getHeight(), xformed_picture.getHeight()); \\t\\tfor (int x=0; x&lt;source.getWidth(); x&#43;&#43;) { \\t\\t\\tfor (int y=0; y&lt;source.getHeight(); y&#43;&#43;) { \\t\\t\\t\\tif (x &lt; 2 &amp;&amp; y &lt; 2) { \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  assertTrue(check_for_white(xformed_picture.getPixel(x, y)));   \\t\\t\\t\\t} else { \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tassertTrue(check_for_black(xformed_picture.getPixel(x, y))); \\t\\t\\t\\t} \\t\\t\\t} \\t\\t}   My guess is that there could be a problem with my ImmutablePixelArrayPicture, because I extended it for the TransformedPicture class.  I&#39;m calculating the pixel value in the getPixel method of Gradient Picture by blending top left pixel with bottom left corner and top left corner at the y value of the pixel of interest as follows:      topleft.blend(bottomleft, y / height).      I repeat for the top right and bottom right, then blend those 2 values together as\\xa0      firstInRow.blend(lastInRow, x / width)      I cast my x and ys as doubles, and have tried height-1 and width -1, but am still failing the component equality tests beginning on line 526 in the adept tests. Any advice?  Hello,   I am currently trying to go through A4, but I am getting a collection of really confusing errors.      For one, almost half of my code is not passing because of stuff that should be getting thrown by my exceptions.      I still have errors like &#34;Expected exception attempting to get out of bounds pixel&#34;   when I have written IllegalArgumentExceptions for every relevant method, checking if x is less than 0 or higher than height/width, depending on which one it is. I&#39;m getting errors about null values not being accounted for too, when I am throwing NullPointerExceptions for each and every time I have a point as a parameter.   Beyond this, I have errors in other tests that seem to be comparing addresses of objects or something, and I have no idea what that is even attempting to refer to, so I have no idea how to troubleshoot it. Image of what I am talking about is below.          Am I missing something? I am really stressing out about this because I still need to write the Adept and Jedi code tonight and I am not even able to work on troubleshooting the actual issues in my algorithm for novice because I am being swamped by this.      Just tried changing the exceptions to illegal argument exceptions, nothing changed. Idk what is happening.  I pass jedi code in junit tests but not on the autograder? Is there a fix?  When, I run through my stuff through the tests, it says some of the getters aren&#39;t working:    Errors.png       Can someone explain why because I have been troubleshooting this, and I can&#39;t figure out what a potential error could be.  None of my picture implementations are showing up in the git staging area. The only things showing up are the original interfaces and pixel classes. Any idea on how to fix this?  We were told in recitation that we&#39;d be getting some practice material for the midterm coming on the 15th. When might that happen?  Waited in the line for over an hour, My Digital Hand said I was ready to be helped and to find\\xa0 the instructor but everyone in the room was busy helping other people, after 10 minutes of waiting the website reset my hand back down. I&#39;m not sure if this was a bug or not but now I have to wait back in line. If someone could look into this so that it won&#39;t happen again that&#39;d be much appreciated.  Initially, I created a PictureImpl class for Novice, but then realized I didn&#39;t need it and deleted it.\\xa0 Now my A4 grader is saying my code has 0% coverage. I tried deleting and recreating the grader in eclipse but now it still doesn&#39;t work.\\xa0 Is there any other way I could fix this?  On the A4Grader on Line 71, theres a test to see if the columns are all the same height. So because of this, we can conclude that column = height. Also the first dimension of a 2d array would be height\\xa0which also means the first index is columns. But\\xa0wouldn&#39;t columns be indicative of width and not height?\\xa0And wouldn&#39;t the first dimension of a 2d array be considered rows and height instead of columns and height?  The test does getPixel(-1, 1); which causes a runtime error like it is supposed to, but that runtime error crashes the test.  Me and several other students are waiting for an la for our cohort. Is someone going to be showing up or should we leave?    The input for the Vertical and Horizontal Picture classes are two Picture objects. I was thinking that because these two classes should be mutable, I could create a\\xa0MutablePixelArrayPicture object and get height, width, etc from the pixel_array. But I don&#39;t see a way to make this possible since the MutablePixelArrayPicture constructors don&#39;t take in Picture objects. How would I be able to access, width, height,pixels in the two Picture objects?  I passed all the test on Gradescope included Novice and Jedi except Adept Test 14. It shows\\xa0   Output: Test failed a4grader.A4AdeptTests.check_for_component_equality(A4AdeptTests.java:556) a4grader.A4AdeptTests.testImmutablePixelArrayPicturePaintOnePixel(A4AdeptTests.java:430)   Does\\xa0anyone know how to solve this?  So every test for A4 Novice passes for me except for one particular part in\\xa0testMutableArrayPictureConstructor2dPixelArray, where it&#39;s supposed to have an exception for when the pixel array includes null columns or null pixels. I&#39;ve run if statements such as if (value == null), if (value.equals(null)), if (null == value) but none of these have worked for the test so far. I&#39;m wondering if there is another way to check whether columns and pixels within the pixel array are null or if I&#39;m just having syntax errors because I&#39;m pretty confident the if statements above should work.  for gradient, do we still implement every paint method? Like for painting one pixel, do we leave all the other pixels blank and just paint the one what it would be if the whole thing was painted?  For the MonochromePicture constructor,   &#34;public MonochromePicture(int width, int height, Pixel value)&#34; . . .\\xa0      First I check for non-positive height and width arguments.\\xa0 Next, I check to see whether the value argument is null by using the following code.      if\\xa0(value.equals(null)) {  \\xa0 \\xa0throw new IllegalArgumentException(&#34;Illegal pixel input&#34;);  }\\xa0      When I run only &#34;testMonochromePictureConstructor()&#34; in A4NoviceTests.java, the test fails due to a NullPointerException.\\xa0 The errors occur at lines 50 and 46 of the a4 Pixel interface, which is where\\xa0the following method is located . . .\\xa0         default public boolean equals(Pixel other, double epsilon) {   return Math.abs(getIntensity() - other.getIntensity()) &lt; epsilon;  }         Do errors occur because null is treated as the &#34;other&#34; argument in this method, and because I cannot use getIntensity() on a null object?\\xa0 If so, how to I check to see whether the value argument of my MonochromePicture is null?\\xa0      \\xa0I also fail the test when I try to use &#34;if\\xa0(value == null).&#34;\\xa0\\xa0      Most of the other\\xa0tests in A4NoviceTests.java also fail due to a NullPointerException.      Thanks.  For example, when the test passes in -1 as a parameter for the width, I am failing even though I am throwing an exception in the code for an illegal parameter. I am failing for other things, like when I have to test to see if the pixel array is null. I am definitely checking these things in my code, so what is causing the test to fail?  I completed all of my code to work with adept tests, but when I run JUnit tests every test fails and I get the error &#34;Cannot instantiate the type VerticalStackPicture&#34; and &#34;Cannot instantiate the type HorizontalStackPicture&#34;. Anyone else have this issue or know how to resolve this?      edit: if it helps, gradescope error says :   Test failed a4grader.A4AdeptTests.&lt;init&gt;(A4AdeptTests.java:46)  Hello,   I am confused on where I am supposed to implement the blend part of this class. I know the constructor is where I initialize my private fields and check for illegal argument exceptions, but I am not sure what method I am supposed to blend the pixels in. Thank you!  What exactly does it mean when you return a new picture object within paint methods? If the purpose of the paint method is to assign the pixel array at a certain index a color, returning a new picture object doesn&#39;t really make the most logical sense for me. For my paint methods, I&#39;ve been just returning &#34;new MutablePixelArrayPicture(pixelarray) and not sure if thats the right thing to return.\\xa0  Im confused as to how exactly we are supposed to be implementing this class. Are we initializing a Pixel[][] inside the constructor with their respective pixel gradients?\\xa0  So my original initialization for the pixel_array that is passed in for constructor1 isn&#39;t working. I&#39;ve tried using/not using the this. , setting the field to a diff/same name, and basically anything else but I can&#39;t seem to understand why I can&#39;t set the passed in array to my array I created as a field.\\xa0      Without the array initialization, all my other tests that require the array are all failing. I included a screenshot of the constructor but blocked off the other coding for honor code reasons. Thanks            On Gradescope, all my tests keep failing line 33 on A4NoviceTests. After seeing what the line is, 33 to 40 is just initializing the Picture, so I&#39;m suspecting that my constructor is the issue.   Although, after checking through my constructors for MutablePixelArrayPicture, everything seems to be correct.   When a new MutablePixelArrayPicture is being called, I&#39;m creating a new pixel array according to the width and height and I&#39;m filling in the pixel array with the initial value.   Is there something else missing?  Hello, I recently resubmitted my code after committing\\xa0it to github. I previously had points but after my most recent commit. I now receive an error message for each test. Although, my JUnit test still works in my eclipse. Also, I have tried to revert back to my previous committed code but that has not worked.\\xa0   For novice, whenever we call blend for a Pixel, are we blending the method&#39;s Pixel by the factor and putting the blended Pixel into the appropriate index OR are we blending the Pixel within the array with the given Pixel and factor?      So in other words:   p.blend(p, factor)   OR   pixel_array[x][y].blend(p, factor)  Can anyone tell me what route to go in passing the partial circle test, I pass all other tests but this one and do\\xa0 not know why my code wouldn&#39;t work.  The build path appears to be configured the same way my working A3 grader was, but there are errors when I try to run the Novice tests         The instructions for creating the immutablepixelarraypicture constructors are exactly the same as mutable. I passed the mutable constructor test but not immutable, and they are exactly the same. I also tried making immutable extend mutable and using the super keyword, but still don&#39;t pass the constructor test. Does anyone know why this is, or am I wrong to do it this way?  For MonochromePicture I copied the pixels into an array (using a for loop) so I could access them as x and y components. This doesn&#39;t work for Gradient because it doesn&#39;t say the value of the pixels so I have nothing to copy. How should I implement this method instead?  I&#39;m having trouble understanding what Monochrome Picture does.   So Monochrome Picture&#39;s constructor doesn&#39;t make a Picture/pixel_array (as per instructions) but instead relies on the paint methods to return a Picture that&#39;s modified but not the exact Monochrome Picture (because it&#39;s immutable).   So, when we&#39;re calling to paint a Monochrome Picture, would we just return a MutablePixelArrayPicture that is filled with the Monochrome Picture value but also has the specific Pixels within the pixel_array modified?  remember to double check the spreadsheet tomorrow for your cohort location and make sure you go to the right place! I know a couple of LAs including myself have switched locations from week to week So for each of the paint methods, we need to return a Picture object. I have a picture class in order to do this. But do MutablePixelArrayPicture and MonochromePicture need to extend the picture class? I have added this but I get a bunch of errors in the constructors so I don&#39;t know if its necessary or not. When I code for the paint methods that don&#39;t take in a factor, I make a method call to the paint methods that do take in a factor. Do we need to create a new picture object before we make this call or after? Or do we only need to create the picture object in the paint methods that take in a factor? I&#39;ve tried to do each but they either return null or return a different picture than what is correct.\\xa0  Does this mean the factor of the blend? I am having a hard time understanding this. I have tried so many different methods and ways of understand this but I keep getting errors or an illegal factor. And now for some reason, I am getting a divide by zero error when I specifically set my code up to not do that or have a case where that happens.      Also, after putting a placeholder for this so I could continue working on Horizontal and Vertical, I was able to get those working (except for the PaintOnePixel tests, which I STILL have not gotten an official response from KMP or the TA team about after being told by multiple TAs it&#39;d be looked into) but when I change GradientPicture around to work on it, I get errors in the other functions&#39; tests for some reason, leading me to continue to believe that A4 Adept&#39;s JUnit is buggy.      Please respond and help me with this situation, I&#39;ve put so many hours into this assignment and have waited literal hours for TA office hours help for little to no results or progress in the assignment and work.      Thanks.        Hey guys, I’m still confused with the relationship between Pixel[][] pixel_array and MutablePixelArrayPicture.\\xa0  So appreciated if someone can help me differentiate them!  Hi,   For some reason, whenever I check if the pixel_array is null or contains any null value in my constructor, the autograder will mark it as wrong. Am I doing something wrong here?\\xa0 Also, this is a more general question in regards to the assignment, but I am having trouble with regards with the return for the default methods. I understand we can&#39;t necessarily create new methods, but how are we supposed to get the method to work properly?  My JUnit test for adept will only run the first test and then it stops.\\xa0 It was working earlier today but now it isn&#39;t.\\xa0 I tried\\xa0deleting the A4 grader from eclipse and I went through the steps to add it again but it still is doing the same thing and I don&#39;t know why.\\xa0 Just seeing if anyone knows how to fix this. Thanks!      It also won&#39;t let me debug since the JUnit isn&#39;t running.  Just for a sanity check, is upper_left [0][0] and upper_right[0][row length] or is it orientated another way?  I am getting all the test pass but I cannot pass Columns in picture are not all the same height. Exception should be thrown.   I have tried many things any ideas???  Can someone give me some advices about why this happened? I just think if the first one can pass then all of the following initializations should also pass. Thanks in advance!   I&#39;m not sure what it&#39;s asking us to do for this implementation. Can anyone explain?  I am having the same problem that some others are having with getting Immutable, Horizontal, and Vertical to pass the PaintOnePixel test. My paint methods in those classes create a new MutablePixelArrayPicture and then return the paint method called on it. All my other Adept tests pass as well as all my novice and jedi tests. What am I doing wrong? Everything seems to be working perfectly but I can&#39;t figure out this last part.\\xa0  What would be a possible reason why gradescope would grade novice correct when I submitted it, but then grade it wrong when I submit the adepts? I didn&#39;t change anything in my novice code when I submitted my adept codes. They should all still be working correctly even if my adept is failing right?  I keep failing the novice test on line 75:      Line 75: \\xa0   Picture invalidNullRow2dPixelArray = new MutablePixelArrayPicture(includesNullRowsPicture);      I understand this is supposed to throw an exception. I tried looping through the array at the 1st dimension and I tested this line myself and got an exception thrown when I\\xa0executed. The\\xa0auto grader\\xa0isn&#39;t passing this test and\\xa0everything is pushed properly to\\xa0GitHub.      Anyone have any ideas?  For VerticalStack Picture and HorizontalStackPicture, all my tests are passing except for the PaintOnePixel() Test. They keep falling when the check-for_component_equality and I really can&#39;t figure out why. Can someone help me try to figure out how to\\xa0write the paint method when it&#39;s just for one pixel?? Not sure where I&#39;m going wrong. I feel like my code should work since everything else is.\\xa0  I followed the a3 grader steps to add the Junit\\xa0tests to work for a4, and a4 is in the class path, but the line that imports a4 is giving me an error. How do I fix this?      Edit: This is the error message that pops up. I have tried hovering over and manually clicking &#34;fix project setup&#34; as well.       Screen_Shot_20190928_at_2.48.20_PM.png   I was having a problem with Adept where JUnit was failing in the constructor region, but I had to leave for a class. A LA that was passing through (who I forget the name of ) that was helping my LA on the problem, said that she would take a look at my github code and see if she could find the issue and message me through piazza.   I just wanted to let that LA that I came back to the help center after that class and I got it all figured out.\\xa0 Thanks for all the help!  All my tests are passing except the PaintOnePixel tests for Immutable, Vertical, and Horizontal. I even have the PaintOnePixel for Gradient working. I find it strange that this easier test is failing but the harder ones are passing fine? All my novice tests passed 100% so I really do not understand what my problem is here. I know someone else who had the same problem. In the ReadMe, it says to &#34;encapsulate references to two Picture objects&#34;; does this mean these two objects should be the only thing encapsulated, or are we allowed to encapsulate additional variables (A 2d array, for example) as well? Is anyone else supposed to be in the General Cohort at 10:00 today? There&#39;s no one here.  What is the acceptable\\xa0value of x and y? Are they supposed to be greater or equals to 0 or just greater than 0  Why are we expected red equals green here? According to the setup, the correct value should be 0.0 right? (See red underline in the pictures below)                 I am planning to create a new object in default methods (all of the paint methods) because most implementations are immutable, but how can I create a new object and clone pixel_array into it? Thanks in advance!  I added the JUnit tests the same way we added it for the last assignment, but I keep getting this:    Is anyone else getting this? Am I missing something?  Can someone explain why this is happening? It&#39;s not giving me a separate reason for all the objects failing but instead this &#34;Illegal factor&#34; exception, where it&#39;s not letting anything else pass or fail or anything. I had all my Novice stuff work fine with the factor checking. My JUnit file might be messed up but I&#39;m not sure...   Normally when a test fails in the autograder it will tell you which one it was. However, when I submitted my A4 I get this message for all the Novice and Adept tests:      Output: Test failed a4grader.A4NoviceTests.&lt;init&gt;(A4NoviceTests.java:33)  Output: Test failed a4grader.A4AdeptTests.&lt;init&gt;(A4AdeptTests.java:32)      What does this mean? I thought it meant that there was a problem with something on line 33, ie before any of the tests are even encountered. However, I was able to put all the code before the tests from A4NoviceTests into a separate file and it ran just fine. If it&#39;s worth mentioning, this doesn&#39;t occur for the Jedi tests (1 and 2 passed, 3 did not but it told me which test was failed).  I am having a lot of trouble with my Paint function in my Immutable Picture Class editing the original Array. I have tried to separately copy every pixel over to a new array with a for loop and have tried using .clone() but neither seemed to work. Is anyone else having trouble with this?? Help please!!  I&#39;ve been having problems with my ShortButFairDispatcher for quite a while now. I&#39;ve been to office hours multiple times and also talked to KMP about it but I still haven&#39;t figured it out. My code is currently passing the first 3 tests for ShortButFairDispatcher, but failing at the fourth test with a value of -11.89999... (expected value is 83.4). A picture of all the tests, errors, instructions, and code will be attached to this post. If anyone could give me some advice/help, it would be greatly appreciated!      Tests:             errors:          ShortButFairDispatcher code:   (*Instructions for ShortButFairDispatcher*\\xa0    This dispatcher should choose the driver that is closest to the client&#39;s position but without considering the last five drivers chosen (you can assume that there will be more than five available drivers). In other words, if your dispatcher first chooses DriverA, then the next four times that the dispatcher is asked to choose a driver, DriverA should not be eligible for being chosen. )       On lines 126 and 127 of A4NoviceTests.Java the following lines exist:    assertEquals (2, randomMutablePicture.getWidth());    assertEquals (4, randomMutablePicture.getHeight());   \\xa0   However, earlier in the file the following declarations are made:      Pixel[][]randomPicture={ {blue,randomColor,randomColor,red},{green,red,green,randomColor}};   Picture randomMutablePicture = new MutablePixelArrayPicture(randomPicture);      Based on the randomPicture\\xa0double array, isn&#39;t the width 4 and the height of that double array 2? You would be stacking two 1x4 arrays to make an array with height two and width 4? Why are the JUnit test assertions written the other way?   \\xa0            on like 316 of the novice tests, it checks that p and result are equal. parray[0][0] is red, but result is changing that to blue. so why should they be equal?  Does anyone have an idea on how to realize the other approach to achieving an immutable method?  I am a bit confused as to what width and height are as compared to x and y. If we access a pixel with\\xa0   pixel_array[x][y]   then should we have that 0 &lt;= x &lt;= height and 0 &lt;= y &lt;= width because there are x rows (the height) and y columns (width)?     If one of the provided coordinate for the function is out of bounds, should the method paint as much as possible or should it throw an error? Ie for the circle one, if cx and cy give the coordinates of the bottom-right corner, should the program paint a quartercircle?      EDIT: I see now that it says any value for cx, cy should be allowed, but what about the one with (ax,ay) and (bx,by)  I&#39;m failing JUnit tests. How should we deal with the pixel of different height? Like:   Pixel[][] differentHeightPicture = { { red, blue, green }, { red, green, blue }, { red, green } };   I tried to throw illegal argument if the pixel_array[0].length is different with pixel_array[2].length, but this would cause a disaster since many JUnit tests do not provide a pixel array has the third row. Thanks!  Our constructors for the immutable object are the same as the ones in mutable, right? It&#39;s only the paint methods that different so that they do not edit the private &#34;pixels&#34; array field directly? How can we implements any default methods in Picture? When we call the paint method, we are supposed to edit the elements of the pixel_array. However, we don&#39;t have access to the pixel_array in the interface. Can we just create a getter for it in the interface?Hi Katherine,      My name is Emma and I am in your 608 recitation. Are you available to meet tomorrow? I am really confused about A4 as I have zero experience with pixels and graphics. I was wondering if we could meet and go over what I have so far so I can get started and understand what the heck I am doing.  Thanks so much, Emma For the pixels other than the four corners, does it mean that we should blend the pixels in four corners separately using function Blend(p, factor), as we can only blend two\\xa0pixels in one time, like &#34;the\\xa0initial\\xa0pixel blend upper-left first, then the result of previous blending blend upper-right pixel, and so on&#34;? So what&#39;s the\\xa0initial pixel (that before all blending processes) should be, as we should use one pixel to blend another?  From this instruction, it seems like I should initialize the pixel array as [width][height],   meaning width represents the number of rows for a picture      The first dimension of pixel_array is the width and the second is the height. In other words, pixel_array.length will be the width of the picture and pixel_array[0].length will be the height of the picture.\\xa0       From this instruction, seems like   height represents the number of rows for a picture      The constructors should throw an IllegalArgumentException if any of the parameters are null or if the geometry of the objects provided is not compatible (i.e., if the  heights  of left and right differ for HorizontalStackPicture or if the  widths  of top and bottom differ for VerticalStackPicture).       Do I misunderstand these statements or the instructions are wrong? I&#39;m a little confused about public Picture paint(int x, int y, Pixel p, double factor) { I know we have to blend p with something but I&#39;m not sure what the other pixel is supposed to be. Where do we set the color of gray to every newly initialized pixels\\xa0  Are\\xa0the last 2 lines of the questions requiring us to create another 2 constructors for the last 2 lines of requirement? Or that 2 lines are the general instructions about the constructor? \\xa0I am a little bit lost in the question and looking for some explanation of this question.   Hi everyone! I just wanted to point out that there are still plenty of cohort slots that are still open (and several cohorts with no one signed up). If you want to be a part of one but no time works for you, please let us know.       Quick reminder of what cohorts are:    Cohorts\\xa0offer you a chance to regularly meet with an LA to get help on anything ranging from assignments to CS career questions.\\xa0 You essentially will meet with the same LA and 6\\xa0or 7\\xa0other students in the class once a week for an hour.\\xa0 Cohorts are optional, but if you choose to be a part of one, attendance is encouraged.\\xa0 They won&#39;t be a part of your grade, and are simply meant to be a resource to help you in this class. If you are interested, use the link below to sign up.       https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AcBjMXOupw8XXfZ05RNZZPXfVG_64n0wZEnGQdpVtSc/edit?usp=sharing   How do you know which methods can be default? I don&#39;t really understand the concept.      Is it about getters and setters? Are those the methods that are default?  Is this only going to differ from the mutable one by the pixel_array being private instead of public? I guess this will also change how we implement the paint methods since we will have to create and return a new MutablePixelArrayPicture. correct?  When you are painting in a monochrome picture, are you changing the entire picture to be the new Pixel or only the specified coordinate? I can&#39;t tell if monochrome pictures are supposed to STAY monochrome no matter what method is called or not.  Since the Pixel interface&#39;s blend function already checks for factor&#39;s legitimacy, do I have to recheck every time a factor is used in a method for the picture objects?  For the mutable array, it simply means we can edit the pixel/pixel array parameter directly, right? And for immutable, we are not allowed to directly change the pixel array values?  I&#39;m so confused: when we are creating a 2-dimensional array(traditionally), shouldn&#39;t it be like   int[][] a = new int [number of rows][number of columns] ?   And in A4 novice,\\xa0why do we\\xa0need to flip this rule? Does it mean that we need to think in the opposite way when encounter 2-dimensional arrays in the future?  The interfaces Pixel and Picture\\xa0 aren&#39;t marked as interfaces on the package explorer tab, meaning I can&#39;t implement them when making new classes for A4 Novice. When I try to create a new class that implements, for example, the Picture interface, the Picture interface does not come up as a suitable interface to implement. How do I fix this? I was able to use this method of creating new classes in A3 with no issues.  req = new RideRequestImpl(new PositionImpl(25,0), new PositionImpl(25,10));  c = new CompletedRideImpl(req, d);  assertEquals(25, c.getWaitTime());  assertEquals(2.0*10, c.getPrice(), 0.005);         I am failing this part of code. I think the ride time should be 25 instead of 20, since the distance is 10. Can someone help me. Thank you!  For A4 Novice, one of the paint methods for Picture requires (cx, cy, radius, p) and uses cx and cy as the center point and filling in each Pixel within the specified radius as p. I&#39;m wondering if we&#39;re making the area that&#39;s filled with Pixel p in the shape of a circle or square?  I can&#39;t seem to firgure out what Novice Test 4 is testing for.      I have written test code to make sure that I am throwing exceptions for edge cases being input for first name, last name, and vehicle.      The setter also changes the vehicle instance in my driver class.         After this past assignment, we&#39;ve seen a bunch of posts with screenshots of code. DO NOT DO THIS. It&#39;s an honor court violation. If you can&#39;t explain it well enough in words or a few lines of code, Piazza is not the place to ask - go to OH.  I wrote ShortButFairDispatcher by taking my ShortestWaitDispatcher code &amp; adding an array list that keeps track of every driver      Every iteration of the for loop checks the available driver to make sure they&#39;re not in the 5 most recent indeces of the array list\\xa0      This method failed the first time because the starting length of the array list was 0, so in desperation I added 6 dummy drivers to the list so subtracting 1/2/3/4/5 from the size doesn&#39;t create an error      However the result of this code has the exact same error (expected 78.1 / actual 79.4) that it\\xa0would if I just copied my ShortestWaitDispatcher code exactly      Please help            I have an ArrayList to keep track of the past drivers but how do implement that to not pick the drivers in my ArrayList?  What changes after the 10th test that would cause this?  Line 211,\\xa0   assertEquals(4, cr1.getWaitTime());   is failing because it expects the wait time to be 4 but the output is 6      I have checked my getManhattanDistanceTo method and my getWaitTime method several times but I can&#39;t find anything wrong with either of them      All of my other novice tests are passing, please help         My simulation values are wrong but the same as the values someone was getting in a comment on &#64;172      My simulation test is outputting all of the correct values but tests Novice 9 and Novice 13 are failing.      Has anyone encountered this, any ideas?  When I test the ShortWaitDispatcher, I keep\\xa0failing all the tests bc my code keeps giving me negative values (i.e. instead of 64.1 i get   -10.899999999999999). I passed both Novice and Jedi so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s any of my price, cost, or profit methods. I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s going wrong with my code.\\xa0        I passed Jedi for this assignment, however because I needed to modify the code in Simulation, it is affecting the tests for Adept. While my ShortestWait test was passing before Jedi, it now breaks when the test tries to create a new Simulation...how should I approach fixing this? Any help is appreciated, thank you!  All my novice tests are passing but when commit and push to github, i don&#39;t get any points in gradescope. Why is this? I did try to modify a couple of things in github but think everything should be running smoothly. All tests are passing.  Guys just giving a little hint because I was stuck debugging Adept1 (ShortButFairDriver) for days having the same error, passing all the tests but the last one. You have to make sure you always have to have 5 drivers in your list of previously chosen driver. In other words, when you are going to enter the 6th chosen driver, is when you delete the driver in position 0. Good luck.  Hi, I&#39;m having some trouble with this failed test:\\xa0   a3grader.NoviceTests.vehicleMoveTest(NoviceTests.java:120)   My problem is here:       When I include vehiclePosition = p; in my code, I get the incorrect output (test 12), but I get test 6 correct. If I comment it out, I get the correct output, but test 6 is incorrect. I&#39;ve been fiddling with this for hours, and I don&#39;t know how to get both correct. Thank you for any input.  So I am trying to write my adept code for ShortButWait, and this happens.   I get through the first two assertEquals just fine, but after this, it spits out a number that is wildly off base.    Is there something I am missing about this code? Because as far as I can tell, all I would need to do is run the waitTime code, find the lowest one, and store the Driver that is associated with the lowest one unless I am missing something major. I also do not  completely  get what the tests are testing for to begin with, so that makes it harder than usual to troubleshoot.  Out of the 20 outputs that the grader is checking from ShortButFairDispatcher, 19 are exactly correct but 1 is wrong. It&#39;s the 6th from last, it should be 84.2 but I&#39;m getting 82.9... any suggestions on what to try? I am having some trouble writing the code for the complete method in the RideRequest class and for the getWaitTime method in the CompletedRide class. From my understanding, in the complete method if isComplete is false we are supposed to make it true, make a completedRide object, and then update the position of the driver&#39;s vehicle to the client&#39;s position and then the destination position. Once that happens though I keep getting errors on novice tests 10 and 12 because my getWaitTime result is not what it should be because it is no longer calculating the distance between the client and the driver&#39;s original position. I think I&#39;m just confused on how to save the driver&#39;s position at the time when the request was made and then how to pass that into the getWaitTime method.   hopefully my question makes sense!! would love some help Something has gone horribly wrong with my repository and I have no idea how to solve it. Would like to meet with someone ASAP.\\xa0  EDIT: I removed everything in this post after reading the recent announcement.  Hi, I&#39;ve been stuck on this for a while, and when I run the SimulationTest, I almost get the correct output. These are the values I get:   Ride 0: -10.60 Ride 1: 36.70 Ride 2: 151.10 Ride 3: 22.50 Ride 4: 81.60 Ride 5: 70.40 Ride 6: 51.10 Ride 7: 50.00 Ride 8: -13.10 Ride 9: 49.70 Total Profit: 489.40      As you can see, I am 50 cents off from the correct total profit, and I can see that Ride 8 is the incorrect output. However, I&#39;m not quite sure where the error could be to just be impacting that output. Any thoughts? Thank you for any input.  I&#39;m having trouble with understanding the complete and getIsComplete methods in the RideRequest interface.      Here are the descriptions of them:\\xa0   * getIsComplete()  * Returns true if this request has been completed, false if not.  * A new RideRequest starts off as not completed and becomes completed  * if the complete method (see below) is invoked.  *   * complete(Driver driver)  * If the RideRequest has not yet been completed, the method should:  * - update the request to indicate that the request has been completed,  * - create a CompletedRide object that captures information  * about the completed ride (see CompletedRide interface)  * - move the vehicle of the driver to the position of the client and   * then move the vehicle to the destination of the ride,  * - and finally return the CompletedRide object.      getIsComplete() depends on complete(). But in that case, what determines if the rideRequest has been completed yet/what &#34;invokes&#34; the complete() method? In other words, I&#39;m confused about what the condition should be in complete (Driver driver).        Hello, I was able to get past errors involving my field array but now I&#39;m not getting the proper output. I believe this may have to do with the syntax of my field, but I am completely lost now. I have my ShortWaitDispatcher() method&#39;s math working, so it&#39;s not my method of deducing the smallest wait time, but it has to do with my way of determining the last five drivers. I was able to pass the first test, but the second test expected 83.4 and my output was -11.8999999999999. Please help   Hello,   I am currently going through the A3 assignment, but after implementing all of the code for novice, my output on the test is incorrect, and I cannot figure out why.   my output is this.       I will update if I figure out what has gone wrong, but I just thought I would ask in case anyone else has experienced something similar.      EDIT:   I fixed my manhattan method (it had the order wrong) and did not let wait time be influenced by the position change, and now my output is this. This still is not right and I am struggling to figure out what to troubleshoot.       Edit: I think there is something wrong with my manhattan distance, because within my junit tests, I get a result of 4 when I should be getting 6. However, I do not see what is wrong with it. This is what I wrote:    The defaultMethodsTest also cannot seem to find this method, so clearly something is going wrong. I really cannot tell what though.   EDIT: I&#39;M SO SORRY. I was accidentally returning x again from my getY instead of y. Sorry for coming to you all for this, I was just getting stressed. All the tests pass now.  I&#39;ve been looking at the second adept part (ShortButFairDispatcher()) for like 2 hours, and I can&#39;t figure out how I&#39;m expected to save the result of a past execution of the method. I even went ahead and finished Jedi and I still can&#39;t get this. I tried making a field array for storing the last 5 drivers but I don&#39;t know how I can have it be a &#34;universal&#34; array that will stay the same upon each execution  When I test the short wait dispatcher, I receive a failed test for the 5th entry in the ridelog because it is expecting 230.00 and my code gives 229.3, but when I calculate it myself with a calculator it also gives me 229.3. I&#39;m unsure if this is a rounding problem or something else because it calculates correctly for the others?          Hi everyone, my ShortestWaitDispatcher passes the first few tests in the autograder however when it reaches line 25, it breaks. Is there anyway to figure out where my code is going wrong? I was trying to compare how my code got to it&#39;s &#34;actual&#34; result but I can&#39;t figure out the error if we don&#39;t know the positions that the grader is using.   what does it mean by this? does it mean the last 5 drivers checked for the shortest distance in the array?  All my novice Junit stuff is passing but when i push to gradescope its not. Any ideas as to why?    I&#39;m getting errors in the A3 grader folder even though I made no changes to it. I tried to re-clone the repository, but it&#39;s not replacing the old code in eclipse even after I deleted the folder in my finder.\\xa0\\xa0I copied and pasted the files from GitHub too and I’m still getting errors. How can I start from scratch again/fix the errors in the code for the a3 grader?  I cannot get my basicRideRequestCompleteTest() to to be true because it says cr1 isn&#39;t equal to cr2, which most likely has to do with how my riderequestimpl&#39;s complete() method checks for a completed ride. Idk how what I have isn&#39;t right but any help is appreciated.  Every test case for my ShortButFair Dispatcher works except for one; it keeps throwing this error:      org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: expected: &lt;138.2&gt; but was: &lt;188.0&gt;;     My calculated profit (188) isn&#39;t equal to the expected profit (138.20). I don&#39;t see why this error only occurs for this one case, because all of the other ones are working. Any idea what could be causing this?    Hi! Everything is working in the entire code except for this one thing in Novice: assertEquals(cr1, cr2) Can someone explain why it is not working and what I am doing wrong. for the last step, when I try to right click on a3 grader package and click on &#34;Run As&#34; , the only option that I can run it as is &#34;1 Java Application&#34;\\xa0   How do I fix this?  My code fails on the 18th adept shortbutfairdispatcher test. It returns 34.4 when 35.7 is expected. I have no idea why it is failing so many tests in. It obviously works correctly for the vast majority of the tests. Did anyone else have a similar issue?  I was trying to follow all the steps of creating jUnit test as it was shown in recitation, however, when I&#39;m uploading my project with jUnit test package,\\xa0package org.junit.jupiter.api is not recognized by the GradeScope:   I see following message on Gradescope, when there is package with my jUnit test   submission/src/JUnitTesting/testRides.java:4: error: package org.junit.jupiter.api does not exist import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*; ^ submission/src/JUnitTesting/testRides.java:5: error: package org.junit.jupiter.api does not exist import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test; ^ submission/src/JUnitTesting/testRides.java:20: error: cannot find symbol &#64;Test   I have the following imports for my JUnit test case:   import a3.*;   import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;   import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;      For comparison, we had the following imports for JUnit test for Calculator in this week&#39;s recitation:   import calculator.*;   import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;   import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;      On my laptop, jUnit works without any issues. Mentioned above error happens only in Gradescope. I have to delete my jUnit test case file, to make sure that Gradescope grades my project correctly.      Is there a way to fix it?         I&#39;ve tried deleting the\\xa0repository &amp; the import from Eclipse and then downloading them again, same result      I believe this prevents Gradescope from grading the assignment  I have the following code in PositionImpl:      public int getManhattanDistanceTo(Position p)  {   if (p == null)  {   throw new RuntimeException(&#34;Position provided has no value.&#34;);  }  int xDistance = Math.abs(p.getX() - this.getX());  int yDistance = Math.abs(p.getY() - this.getY());  return xDistance &#43; yDistance;  }      When junit checks p for null it misses a branch. I have the same thing to check for null input everywhere else in my code, and this is the only place where it doesn&#39;t get covered. What can I try to make junit cover the exception throwing?  I am having trouble understanding the syntax for the default test methods. I wrote a default void isDefault method within the interface that gives the throw RunTimeException. But after writing it in the interface, I am not sure how to test for it within my class.\\xa0   Thank you!

But something is still going wrong         Can anyone offer any thought about why I passed first several test for shortWaitDispactcher but gradually deviated from the correct answer? Does the shortWaitDispatcher class only need us to find the driver with shortest distance and return that driver?

Since a3 grader should essentially be what gradescope tests us on, does anyone know why this would be happening?  When both driver_pos and clientPosition are (0,0), why there will be a NullPointerException for waitTime?   Seems like getManhattanDistanceTo() will return null, which should not occur.

I&#39;m still failing a few JUnit tests and the defaultMethods test doesn&#39;t make any sense. I haven&#39;t seen any &#34;default&#34; properties of methods. Can anyone explain how it works?  If you plan to answer, please read in entirety.   I&#39;ve browsed Piazza and looked at all available solutions for this, and I am still coming up short.      I already made a new CompletedRide object in Riderequest, and here is the code for that:       II am aware that I need to use the initial driver position for this new CompletedRide, but for some reason it still wasn&#39;t using its initial position despite me moving the driver after I made the new object. Therefore, I created a variable to hold that initial position in CompletedRideImpl, which is this:    anotherCompPic.PNG    Since I&#39;ve taken double measures to hold the driver&#39;s initial position, I literally have no idea what else is wrong.   I have looked into the NoviceTests, tracked my driver positions, and for some reason, at this step, my waitTime is still being calculated from the driver&#39;s position after moving instead of their initial position.      Just for reference, this is the error:   advancedRideRequestCompleteTest()   expected &lt;4&gt; was &lt;6&gt;      I know what the issue is, I just have no idea how to fix it.      Please give me your valuable insight!  I used the tester code and everything is working except for the ones that test with null values. I had runtime exceptions but it doesnt seem like they are working. I&#39;m not sure what I am doing wrong since I did it like we did in the example code in class.  If we can&#39;t make it to our regular recitation time, is it okay if we show up to a different section? Who would we need to get in touch with about that? Also what are the names of the head LAs; I can&#39;t seem to find that anywhere.  For correctly calculate the Wait time, we need the Clientposition where driver pick up the client and also the position of the end of last order. To\\xa0 record the position of last order, I add a position attribute. Is this way allowed? I just think it may be diffeerent from the way that KMP wants us to do.  I just finished a3 adept, and wanted to upload it to gradescope as insurance.\\xa0 I have not yet attempted a3 Jedi.\\xa0 However, I got a 10/10 on the assignment.\\xa0 Just wanted to make you aware.  I just followed the instruction on sakai to run the JUnit5 Grader, but the eclipse showed the error in the picture. How can I handle that?

I add JUnit 5.3 and a3-project to dependencies, but I get &#34;cannot resolve symbol&#34; error.  will the auto grader be up before Friday. We may need to go to office hours if we find out our code is incorrect.  Just curious:    Why is there a question mark on every implementation\\xa0class?  How do you even begin thinking about ShortButFairDispatcher? Doesn&#39;t the Dispatcher implementations only get called each time the Simulation calls it? So how can it remember the previous drivers? Just looking for a push in the right direction.  What does it mean when it says in the complete() instructions to &#34;move the vehicle of the driver to the position of the client and then move the vehicle to the destination of the ride&#34;? Isn&#39;t that redundant when I can just move the the vehicle directly to the destination without moving it to the client first? Or am I misreading something? My simulation is all messed up but I am 99% certain all my implementations and interfaces are fine except here, where it seems unclear about how this method works.      Thank you  I&#39;m getting an error to do with referencing a non-static object with a static method. I&#39;m trying to get the wait time but when I use the manhattan distance method it&#39;s giving me this static error. I used it earlier with no problem (for getRideTime) but now it&#39;s giving me this error.      Thank you.  Do the absences for recitation need to be excused? I know we have to attend 9 of the 12, but to not have points deducted from our recitation attendance grade do they have to be excused?\\xa0  I&#39;ve been stuck trying to implement getWaitTime() in the CompletedRiderImpl class.

Thanks! :)  Before the correction note I always got the intended output. Without moving driver to client and then to destination. However after I did what the correction suggested I get this output. I wonder if someone else has the same problem?

Hey\\xa0everyone,      I&#39;m Max Nabokow, a freshman majoring in CS. I have been developing\\xa0iOS apps for about a year now, and I plan to continue that in college, hoping to release\\xa0an app to the App Store every semester. Because more brains can come up with more ideas and get more work done,\\xa0I would like to start\\xa0an  app development team  here at UNC. Are you interested?\\xa0Maybe YOU are exactly the person I am looking for!      Do you have experience in    iOS development using  Swift ?   Back-end  development for mobile applications?   UI/UX  design?  Graphic design?       If you answered any of those questions with yes and you want to work on something other than COMP 401 homework, go ahead and email me (  mnabokow&#64;unc.edu  ) and/or DM me on Instagram ( &#64;max.nabokow ). I am hoping to build a  3-6 people  team of enthusiastic designers and developers, so please reach out if you are interested! We will also be working together with the UNC AppLab, which\\xa0should\\xa0be a great resource for us.   As of now,\\xa0I do not have a specific app idea for this semester, so there will also be potential for you all to have a say in that.\\xa0Although I have not done any Android development yet, we might consider going cross-platform as well.       Really looking forward to this!       Thank you,   Max Nabokow  What content will pop quizzes cover? Like everything we have discussed in class?  Just wanted to ask if A3 will be released soon.  How does late homework submission work?      For example i submitted A2 novice and A2 adept on time (7/10 on gradescope). Just got done with A2 jedi and submitted for 10/10 on gradescope (the HashMap utility is what I ended up using to keep track of the meals and the ingredients in each meal).\\xa0      How many point are taken off for the late submission?\\xa0  When will be the proper time to show my codes for a previous assignment to my class fellows? Say if someone wants to discuss A2 with me,\\xa0 when can I just show him/her my entire assignment codes   *TL;DR*  We are excited to offer conceptual help in the Learning Lab! The Lab is open from 5-7 Tuesday-Thursday.  Have you ever waited in Office Hours for help on a conceptual question or been intimidated to ask a question in your large recitation section? If so, we have a solution for you! The Learning Lab is a new initiative from the CS Department to provide accessible and collaborative assistance on understanding key concepts from introductory CS courses, including: 110, 283, 290, 380, 401, 410, and 411. We are excited to offer this resource in addition to the traditional Office Hours and recitations that already occur!   *What is the Learning Lab?*  The Learning Lab is designed to be your one-stop shop for conceptual help. A typical Learning Lab session will involve a group of TAs discussing material from lecture and answering questions in a small group session. We will NOT help you on any assignments or labs in the Learning Lab, but it is a great place to reinforce your understanding of material and work with other students in a smaller setting.   *Why Should You Care?*  The Learning Lab closes the gap between the wait times for one-on-one help in Office Hours and the daunting group sizes of recitation. By attending the Learning Lab, you will have many opportunities to meet other students taking the same classes as you are and guarantee that there will be a set time in the week that you can reinforce material from lecture with your TAs.   *How Do I Attend?*  Simply come to FB007 during the Learning Lab hours of operation. Each week, the general hours will be from 5:00-7:00PM on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.  I had to miss class today, and I&#39;m wondering if KMP gave any further update on A3? I know he announced yesterday on Sakai that if he didn&#39;t have the assignment posted by class time on the 10th that he would adjust the deadline- did he say anything further in class? Just wondering, I know the link hasn&#39;t been posted yet.\\xa0      Thanks y&#39;all!  I cannot find any dates for the quizzes on the syllabus. Are these announced?  So I submitted my A2 assignment last night on time and got 8/10 and could not figure out how to get full credit. But today I worked on it again and figured it out for 10/10 but submitted it late. I am wondering if my late penalty will make my grade anything less than an 8/10? Which was my original grade for finishing on time.\\xa0  Does anyone know where I can find the contact information (e-mail addresses specifically) of the head LAs (the ones who teach the recitation sections)? I feel like there should be a page with that information somewhere but I cannot for the life of me find it. Thanks!  For A2 Adept, I am getting a rounding error when I try using String.format(&#34;%.2f, value).\\xa0 I have the price initialized as a double at 0 each time in the loop, then i add ounces * price for each ingredient in the roll.\\xa0 For some test cases i get a value 0.01 more than the expected output.\\xa0\\xa0  Eclipse won&#39;t run my code. How do I fix this?\\xa0      For A2 novice, I try to keep track of the name of the ingredient with the highest / lowest calorie per dollar using a String variable and then use this String variable (thinking it is updating with a for loop I have running calculations after I have initialized that variable) for the print job at the end of the program. Whenever it prints, however, that variable shows up not being updated and shows up with whatever value I initialized it with. I then figured that that had to do with String variables being immutable and so tried using an array type instead, updating its given indexes with the string variables through the for loop as it compares the respective calorie per dollar numbers , but this had the same result of printing whatever the array was initialized to have at those given indices. Just was wondering if anyone knew of a way to hold a string value under a given string variable name but be able to update the value later on (or how else maybe to go about the problem). (by the way, I am using a class for ingredients with each instance of the ingredient having all of the fields you would think as well as a calculated calories per dollar variable for each instance--- maybe that has something to do with it) Thanks  when will assignment 3 be posted? Whenever I try to run A2 I get this error. I&#39;m not sure how to get rid of it, any help or suggestions?   84Exception in thread &#34;main&#34; java.util.InputMismatchException \\tat java.base/java.util.Scanner.throwFor(Scanner.java:939) \\tat java.base/java.util.Scanner.next(Scanner.java:1594) \\tat java.base/java.util.Scanner.nextInt(Scanner.java:2258) \\tat java.base/java.util.Scanner.nextInt(Scanner.java:2212) \\tat a2.A2Novice.main(A2Novice.java:19) I got an array list thats being declared as this   ArrayList&lt;String&gt; order = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();   and I&#39;m using a while loop to add the next scanned item to the ArrayList order.   while (!(scan.next().equals(&#34;EndOrder&#34;))) { \\torder.add(scan.next()); }   Although, when I provide the input and type &#34;EndOrder&#34; the console doesn&#39;t seem to do anything and the console says&lt;terminated&gt;   On Gradescope, one of the tests says its a NoSuchElementException issue. What does this exception mean specifically?  what are you all doing to keep track of the ingredient names and ounces? I tried to make arrays in a for loop to collect the inputs, but I&#39;m not sure how I could access the array values in my while loop at the end that accepts the orders. (since the initial arrays would disappear after the for loop ends. Another reason I didn&#39;t understand is because the number of ingredients can change for each recipe, so i&#39;m having to initialize the array\\xa0 inside  of the for loop based on the input.  Is there any method like .equals for string objects except its &#34;not equals&#34; or != for strings?      I&#39;m trying to use them for a while loop where if the next scanned String is equal to &#34;EndOrder&#34; then it will exit the while loop.  For A2 Jedi, I&#39;m having difficulty with getting my menu items to populate into an array when asking the user for their selection of menu items. For the first test, I am using a while loop that evaluates if the user has entered &#34;EndOrder&#34; or not, and if not then check the first item in the menu item array and see if there&#39;s a match. However, Avocado_Roll (based on test 1) seems to be the only menu item that is being read and populated into the array and I&#39;m not sure how to work around this. I&#39;m also not using 2D arrays as if I&#39;m not sure if that makes the program easier.  For the Jedi part of assignment 2, I&#39;m having trouble associating a menuItem with its recipe items (name, amountOunces). I&#39;m trying to use parallel arrays, but each menu item can have multiple recipe items with name and amount. Not sure how to structure this in arrays and save for later use.   I think I know how to do this with couple of additional classes (RecipeItem, MenuItem), but I&#39;m trying to do this with simple arrays (parallel/multi-dim)      Any ideas?  I&#39;m trying to build an array of objects and use the scanner to input objects into the array. To build each object using the scanner I made a helper method, but I keep getting\\xa0an error that reads:      No enclosing instance of type A2Novice is accessible. Must qualify the allocation with an enclosing instance of type A2Novice (e.g. x.new A() where x is an instance of A2Novice).          What does this mean?     I&#39;m initializing an array as this:   String[][] itemIngredients = new String[menuCount][];   Where the second bracket is blank because I need further input from scanner to determine the length of the array.   After, I fill in the array using two for loops:      for (int m = 0; m &lt; menuCount; m&#43;&#43;) { \\titemName[m] = scan.next(); \\tint ingredientCount = scan.nextInt(); \\tfor (int n = 0; n &lt; ingredientCount; n&#43;&#43;) { \\t\\titemIngredients[m][n] = scan.next(); \\t\\tounces[m][n] = scan.nextDouble();\\t\\t \\t} }   Although, I get a null pointer exception when I enter an itemIngredients string value into [m][n].   I&#39;m wondering if this issue is happening because I didn&#39;t declare the length of the second row.   Or is not declaring the length of the second dimension completely fine and there&#39;s another issue happening that I&#39;m missing??    When I initialize my arrays, I do it like this:      double[] avg = new double[4];      And I am under the impression that this makes an array with 5 slots (0 - 4) that are all automatically declared as empty for me. I want to fill in the slots as I go, but whenever I try, it tells me Null Pointer Exception. I don&#39;t understand why this is happening if I declared an array with 5 slots already, ready to be filled.      I&#39;ve solved this problem by making a for loop and manually setting each slot to 0 directly afterwards, but that seems unnecessary. Is there a better way to go about this?  In Adept test 1, my output of the Avocado_roll was 53 calories, instead of 52, and the similar question happened on the KMP_roll. I followed the format on github\\xa0and don&#39;t understand why. This is my code:   sumOfC = sumOfC &#43; (( int ) (c * amountOfIngredients[k] &#43; 0.5));   Anybody knows why?  my local and remote repos arent synched up so i was wondering how to force push from eclipse to github?  So KMP talked about these things today in lecture, and I&#39;m gonna be honest, I have absolutely no idea what he&#39;s talking about. I know we&#39;ve gone over static before, but I still don&#39;t get it. And with abstraction, I get it&#39;s somehow related to objects? But that&#39;s basically it.  Gradescope only gave me 8/10 for A2, giving me two issues in A2 Novice.              Just looking at the input with my eyes alone, I can see that for Test 1, Seaweed has the most calories, not rice, and\\xa0Rice clearly has the least.\\xa0 Gradescope is expecting strange things for some reason.   For Test 3, gradescope seems to have similar issues.      Does anyone know what I should do?\\xa0 I don&#39;t want to program in some exception case for that particular input just for Gradescope, but also don&#39;t want to get only 8/10.  when i try committing and pushing to github, it doesn&#39;t seem to have gone through. i also keep getting this message\\xa0saying something is rejected?       For this assignment are points going to be taken off for coding style or for specific formatting requirements? when I try committing and pushing my changes to github in the git staging window it says there are no unstaged changes. I know this isn&#39;t the case because i haven&#39;t submitted my work for A1Jedi yet. why is this happening? So I run my code on Eclipse and it runs without errors. I send it through gradescope to see if the novice section is 3/3 to continue on to adept but when gradescope runs the code, it produces an error????  Dear instructor,\\xa0      In the A1 example, the program shows that: &#34;Your Java version: 1.8.0_221&#34;, which is different from &#34;12.02&#34; in your videos. Would it be a problem?     Whenever I try to commit and push this error comes up:   Can&#39;t connect to any repository: https://github.com/Fall2019COMP401-001/a1-jfea40.git (https://github.com/Fall2019COMP401-001/a1-jfea40.git: git-receive-pack not permitted on &#39;https://github.com/Fall2019COMP401-001/a1-jfea40.git/&#39;)      I am signed in properly, but it does not come up on github either  So the input we give to A1Adept is:    6 Apple 0.25 Banana 0.75 Milk 3.15 Orange 1.25 Salami 2.50 Sponge 1.15 3  Carrie Brownstein 3 2 Banana 1 Orange 2 Milk Corin Tucker 2 3 Banana 2 Sponge Janet Weiss 1 5 Salami    So you&#39;d have to store the prices and names of each item in an array before going on to applying them to each customer, right?   How would you make it so that when you give    Carrie Brownstein 3 2 Banana 1 Orange 2 Milk    That\\xa0it would automatically link the &#34;Banana&#34; price from before to the &#34;Banana&#34; that&#39;s being asked for Carrie? When I try putting in the example input code into A1 Jedi, I get an error message that says something is wrong with my line of code where I scan in the price of the item. My code for that line is: double priceOfItem = scan.nextDouble();  The error message looks like this in my console after I enter the example input code:  3 Carrie Brownstein 3 2 Banana 0.75 1 Orange 1.25 2 Milk 3.15 Corin Tucker 2 3 Banana 0.75 2 Sponge 1.15 Janet Weiss 1 5 Salami 2.50Exception in thread &#34;main&#34; java.util.InputMismatchException \\tat java.base/java.util.Scanner.throwFor(Scanner.java:939) \\tat java.base/java.util.Scanner.next(Scanner.java:1594) \\tat java.base/java.util.Scanner.nextDouble(Scanner.java:2564) \\tat a1.A1Adept.main(A1Adept.java:19)   I suppose it has to do something with the fact that I said priceOfItem is a double, but I used the same code in my A1 Adept project and it worked fine. Can anyone provide some clarity? (I also know that we don&#39;t use the prices of the items in the output for A1 Jedi but we still have to scan it in for input) Are we allowed to use object-oriented programming for A1Adept and A1Jedi, or\\xa0do\\xa0we have stick to just using built-in data types? Thank you! I left eclipse open for the past 2 days on my laptop and had saved all my work, but when I came back on this morning it said there was an error and that A1 Adept had been deleted. I had already submitted all my work for A1 adept on grade scope and it had all been correct but now it is missing. Is there ANY way to fix this???!!! Sos. I am failing jedi tests 2 and 3. For test 3, my counter is counting 4 bananas instead of 2 because I&#39;m obviously just counting them by item and not taking the name into account. Has anyone else encountered this and knows a quick way to implement so that before I do my &#34;&#43;&#43;&#34; It makes sure its not in the same customer name? I cant figure out this last step! Thanks!  Ok, I tried just about any type of formatting with these print lines. I have no idea what&#39;s incorrect. I&#39;ve tried looking at other posts and it seems to not apply to me.       Output: Biggest: Janet Weiss (12.50) Smallest: Corin Tucker (4.55) Averege: 8.70  Output did not match expectations. Expected output: Biggest: Janet Weiss (12.50) Smallest: Corin Tucker (4.55) Average: 8.70   Also here&#39;s my code if that helps!   \\t\\t\\t// output \\t \\t\\tSystem.out.println(&#34;Biggest: &#34; &#43; maxBuy.printline()); \\t\\t \\t\\tSystem.out.println(&#34;Smallest: &#34; &#43; minBuy.printline()); \\t\\t \\t\\tSystem.out.println(&#34;Averege: &#34; &#43; average);   And here&#39;s the methods if that also clears up anything!   \\tprintout = (this.wholename&#43; &#34; (&#34; &#43; this.total &#43; &#34;)&#34;);     I submitted my code but the autograder shows me that Example Test isn&#39;t working? What code is this supposed to be? The expected output seems to be matching my output  I am struggling to figure out how to avoid the duplication problem when counting the number of customers who have bought a specific item (ex. Janet Weiss 2 Salami 2 Salami 1 Salami shows up as &#34;3 customers bought 5 salami&#34; in my output). Does anyone have any advice for this issue? :)     For the first assignment, besides just submitting and running the novice, adept, and jedi parts on github gradescope. Is there anything else we have to submit?  I can&#39;t use the run function, its giving me an error stating the ANT Build cannot be found   Good evening class. Quick question how is the price of a menu item compute?      I had the understanding that it was ounces * pricePerOunces for each ingredient, but in the sample input for the first case where we have:   Rice -&gt; 0.5 Ounces * 0.12\\xa0pricePerOunces   Avocado -&gt; 0.5 Ounces * 0.22\\xa0pricePerOunces   Seaweed -&gt; 0.1 Ounces * 2.95\\xa0pricePerOunces      The total gives me $0.52.      Any suggestions?  My console prints the following before I hit &#34;enter&#34; on A1, Adept      Biggest: Carrie Brownstein (9.05) Smallest: null null (0.00) Average: 3.02 Biggest: Carrie Brownstein (9.05) Smallest: null null (0.00) Average: 4.53      After hitting enter however, the correct values print... (see below)      Biggest: Janet Weiss (12.50) Smallest: Corin Tucker (4.55) Average: 8.70      I also had a similar issue on Novice where the third name only appeared after I hit &#34;enter&#34;, but despite this my Novice still passed the autograder.      How do I proceed? Is it my code or a console setting?      edit: after separating the System.out onto different lines it passes Adept 2 but only adept 2, not the others despite the correct output coming after i hit enter     I ran the A1example in my Eclipse, and then found out that my java version is 1.8.0_191. How can I update it? Or, am i able to finish the hw\\xa0without updating?  Whenever I try to save my code for adept, this error comes up saying that the &#34;current target virtual machine...is unable to replace the running code with the code in the workspace.&#34; This error only shows for my adept code and not for novice or jedi.   Does anyone know how I can fix this?  Does anyone know the entry code we need for My Digital Hand? I&#39;m trying to make an account for office hours, but it says there&#39;s an entry code to join the class.  I&#39;m not sure if anyone else is having this problem, but this example (I got the rest correct) shows up wrong, even though my output is the same as the expected output, even the spaces, Gradescope says it&#39;s incorrect.    Is there any difference???????????????????       Adept Test 2 &amp; 3  both work but  Test 1  tells me that my output\\xa0did not match expectations......        So for my A1 Adept code, everything works however I get none of the points because there is a space between the name and the parenthesis, however when I test it in my console on Eclipse, there is no space. Not sure what to do about this.  title  does anyone know how to fix &#34;Editor does not contain main type&#34; error  Despite what the announcement says, there appears to be no invitation link.      When I run my example code, following KMP along in the youtube video, every time I run the example code my output is &#34;my average height is 68.31 inches&#34; instead of &#34;Your Java version: 12.0.2&#34;. \\xa0I didn&#39;t change anything in the example code so I have no idea where this is coming from. \\xa0This is what my screen looks like. \\xa0i also don&#39;t know why I have the &#34;Branches, tags, and references&#34;, etc sidebars. Thanks!      I follow the instructions to import the homework a1, but it shows error. Can anyone figure it out?\\xa0        This may be a dumb question, but I couldn&#39;t find it on the syllabus. Do we have unlimited submissions to gradescope before the due date? Is there any punishment to submitting too many times? In other words, are points deducted from our grades with each submission? Thanks for the help! For every example it says that it could not find or load main class a1.A1Example. What shall I do then?    Can we create inner classes for Customers and Products, and use ArrayLists in Assignment 1? I know that these topics are not covered in this class yet. Or is it better just to stick to Arrays for now?    According to the assignment, we need to make our repositories private. I tried to look up how to do it on the internet and according to the official GitHub tutorial, it should be done through &#34;Settings&#34;, which is located under the repository name. Here is the screenshot from GitHub tutorial:       I don&#39;t have &#34;Settings&#34; under my repository name. In &#34;Method For Setting up Repo as Eclipse Project&#34;, there is &#34;Settings&#34; option available.\\xa0       Is anybody else having the same problem? Did I do something wrong? Or should I just continue with the assignment?  When do office hours start??  I used the 2 decimal place rounding expression on the line above my print statement, but my output is\\xa0      C. Brownstein: 9.05 C. Tucker: 4.55 J. Weiss: 12.5   instead of      C. Brownstein: 9.05 C. Tucker: 4.55 J. Weiss: 12.50      Edit: I fixed the problem by creating a string variable and assigning it the rounding expression using the double variable  Does the commit message have to be something actually useful, or is it just for us to document to ourselves so we can keep track of edits? AKA, is anyone else going to be reading them? I kept making a lot of small edits to my code, desperately trying to find whatever small bug was causing it to not run, and it got to the point where I was flustered and half of my messages were just along the lines of &#34;okay, maybe this time it will work please&#34; or &#34;PLEASE WORK&#34; or &#34;ahhhhhhh&#34;. I&#39;ll properly document my code with commit messages if needed, but is it used by anyone other than me?

When I tried to reset password on Gradescope, the email said:        A request to reset your password on Gradescope has been made, but we could not find a user associated with email address         How could I get access to Gradescope?         I&#39;m more familiar with IntelliJ IDEA, so I was wondering if I could use IntelliJ IDEA to finish my homework.  Thanks!        Why did I miss Adept Test 1, while other Adept Tests are correct?  Hi everyone. I noticed that KMP said in the video that I can change the associate account with Github. I did that and set my unc email as my primary account. I did that before I registered for gradescope but after I receive the invitation. I have received the first point on my gradescope with my current account. Will that be fine\\xa0if I continue to use this account?  how do you make the code round to 2 decimal places?\\xa0  Hello, I am the graduate student major in information science but I didn&#39;t register in this course successfully. However, I hope to audit this course and\\xa0 complete the required assignments. Could someone share the specific requirements of first assignment?\\xa0 Thank you so much!  I submitted my code to Gradescope and I get 0 out of 1 for all the tests for novice even though I get the right output in eclipse. On Gradescope it shows that I have no output but I do get output when I use my code on eclipse.      Does anyone know what I should do?  How long is it taking you guys to complete a section of the assignment (novice, jedi, etc)?      It took me around 3 and a half hours just to finish novice, and on top of that, an extra ~40 mins just to figure out how to get it to two decimal places.      I&#39;m just asking because I want to know if I desperately need to try harder, or if someone else is sharing my struggle to adjust.      Thanks!  Hi, what is the class code for our course&#39;s gradescope? Gradescope will not let me sign up without the class code even when using my UNC email address. Thank you.  I used a wrong account in the autograder and it seems that I cannot change the linked account there. Is there any way to fix that? Thanks!    I used my personal GitHub account for GitHub classroom and associated my name with it. How can I change the association to be with my new Github account that uses my UNC email?

I&#39;m especially excited, as decorator is one of my favorites.   \\xa0   I attached\\xa0the lecture slides and example code to this note. Feel free to download them to follow along with me on your computer.   \\xa0   See you in class!      \\xa0    Lecture Material:    \\xa0   Tuesday\\xa02/27\\xa0(Decorator Design Pattern):   \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0 Slides:\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 pptx \\xa0 \\xa0  pdf    \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0 Example Code:\\xa0 \\xa0 Lecture15.jar ,\\xa0 https://github.com/nkomirisetti/Lec15.git           How to Import Example Code JAR Files Into Eclipse        create new Java project with file name (ex.

Can one of the ta&#39;s or KMP please change it, I posted on here since I cannot comment on regrade answers in gradescope.   On a8 I got a grade that was presumably out of 30 points, and then it got rescaled (i&#39;m assuming, because my points doubled?) to be out of 60. Does that mean A8 assignment will be out of 60 points anyway because my grade got scaled to fit that?  Will our finals be scanned and posted on gradescope for us to see what we got wrong?  Hi, I was just looking at the Syllabus and I can&#39;t find any sort of indication of a grade scale. What would an A, A-, B&#43; be in this class?   Thanks.  I noticed that final grade is posted on Sakai. will there be an announcement about the final grade like what is the average and will there be a curve?  To clarify other piazza posts, is the option to submit a regrade request no longer available?      (The only reason I didn&#39;t do it earlier is because on Monday when KMP sent a message that\\xa0A8 regrade requests\\xa0would be handled after the final\\xa0was graded, I thought that meant we could still submit requests later, so I put it off since I was preoccupied by finals)  Can we get any more detailed evaluation than &#34;minor flaws in logic?&#34;  Is A8 still being graded for everyone or is what is on the gradescope the final grade for A8?  Was there a deadline to submit a regrade request for A8? I don&#39;t see a button for it on Gradescope, only a resubmit button.  Is A8 still being graded?  Polymorphic methods with the same name must have distinct method signatures. The answer is True. But isn&#39;t an overridden method a form of polymorphic method and overridden methods must have same signature  Do you have to put &#64;Override over every overridden method, or is that just a safety thing?   Does anyone know why he created 3 individual fields for each card instead of a Card array?   And why would he use cards[0].getRank() and cards[1].getRank() to compare rank values and not a,b,c?   Since cards array was only returned in the getCard() method and not a field?   then for the isStraight method, he switched back to a,b,c, is there a reason for all that?       In the submission for A8, it said I\\xa0did not have a BeltView and did not get any points in this section - however, my code provides what I believe is the correct implementation on my computer and I even downloaded my github commit again and opened the files to see if it works. I submitted a regrade request but I was wondering if there could have been any other issues with compiling/etc that would have caused this error if someone else is trying to access the files. If so, is there any way I can still earn points back?  I saw that my A8 was graded and I got points off for not allowing the user to name the roll that they create but in the instructions of the Chef UI it never said that that was a requirement. I was wondering if I could resubmit that to include the code for that part of the assignment since it wasn&#39;t clarified.      Thanks!  public interface InterA extends InterB { } public interface InterB { } public interface InterC extends InterA, InterD { }   public class B implements InterB { } public class C extends B implements InterC { }      C c1 = new C();      InterB ib2 = (InterA) ((B) c1);      The answer key says that this is legal, but I don&#39;t understand how it is. c1 can be casted to B, but B can&#39;t be casted to InterA. I even put it in Eclipse to check to see if this works, but it throws an exception saying that it can&#39;t be casted to InterA.  Does anyone know why the constructor on the answer key is protected and not private? I know it was mentioned in class multiple times that the constructor should be private, so I&#39;m a little confused as to why it is not.\\xa0  Does anyone understand how to unwrap the decorator object?  Hi all! I&#39;ve spent the past couple days writing up a study guide for tomorrow&#39;s exam and figured I&#39;d share it. Note: this isn&#39;t a completely comprehensive study guide as it&#39;s more tailored to what I needed to review. Regardless, I feel I was able to include most of the material. Also, if any of you notice information that is wrong within the study guide, please let me know so I can fix it. Good luck tomorrow!       COMP_401_Science_Study_Guide.docx      I suppose that method overriding is a kind of polymorphism and the overriden method can have the same method signature as the overriding method. Then why this is true.\\xa0    Can someone explain why when the array is returned, the length of new Person[] is 0? I thought you needed to set it as people_in_range.size()...  I know a lot of people have their A8 grades out of 60 but mine still says ungraded, is this normal? Does anyone else&#39;s say ungraded?  Because we didn&#39;t do any assignments about decorators or the factory design pattern this semester, what are the odds we&#39;ll have a FRQ about them? Is it worth studying/figure out how to do that? Or should we just focus on iterators and observers.  Can someone tell me why these are T/F?\\xa0           TRUE -\\xa0 Class variables can be accessed by instance methods but instance variables    cannot be accessed by class methods.       FALSE -\\xa0 Traversing an array using an integer index incremented as a for-loop variable is an example of the iterator design pattern.       TRUE -\\xa0 Polymorphic methods with the same name may have different return types.       TRUE -\\xa0 The Decorator pattern makes use of delegation.           FALSE \\xa0-Java user interface components employ the delegation design pattern by registering &#34;listeners&#34; for specific types of events.                      Which model view controller image (from the slides) is representative of what we have to know for the final? I feel like there would be many arguments of whether the view can respond to the model (1st image), or if the view and model are completely separate (2nd image).      How would you write the constructors so that they chain?\\xa0  Simple question but...      If I have parent class method:      public String wordMethod(String word) {}      and then I make a subclass method:      public String wordMethod(int wordNumber) {}      is it overriding or overloading?      Similarly, if I don&#39;t change the number of parameters but I change the return type, is it overriding or overloading?  Within my code I pass a DicePair as a parameter in the constructor and register the observers in the constructor to the DicePair and\\xa0simply change the already created method names to update(). In the final example code, they do not have the observers register themselves and additional methods are added which are specific to DiceObservers that call already created methods within the given code. Would my code receive full credit, or should I take out registering observers within their own constructor and add new methods specific to if the classes are used as DiceObservers that call given methods.      Similarly, in the review session, the example code also did not have the observers register themselves, but I know code examples in class do this. What is the correct way to go about using the design pattern?      For Reference:                  Do getters by JavaBeans convention have to be declared in getSomething() as its method name? The currentBatteryLevel() returns a private instance field so I thought it would classify as a getter but I&#39;m guessing it doesn&#39;t follow JavaBean convention because it isn&#39;t getBatteryLevel()?     Let&#39;s say you have two overloaded methods,   Can you call one version\\xa0in another?   If so what are the conditions that you must follow? like it must be the first line of the code or something?  2013 Spring midterm and 2015 Spring midterm, what&#39;s the difference between the two?   How come one is true and another is false?    On some of the practice exams for the final question it says &#34;Decorator&#34; or &#34;Observer/Observable&#34; etc., and on others it just says &#34;Code Writing&#34; or something like that.   I know we should know the differences well enough to be able to infer what we are doing from reading the question, but I just wanted to know if the final is going to explicitly state what design pattern we are doing or not.   Thanks  In the guest lecturer&#39;s slides and explanation of the decorator pattern all of his decorated classes extended the original interface. In the review session saturday the powerpoint stated that you MUST create new classes AND interfaces in the decorator pattern. Can someone please explain the reasoning behind this inconsistency? Thank you!  Does any one know where/how we can see our grades for the class that include assignments, the midterm and attendance? Thanks!  I added up the points for each assignment and got a total of 125 points possible.\\xa0 How many points is code style worth?\\xa0 What is the total number of points possible for assignments?  hi i was wondering if a8 is out of 60, which is what it says on gradescope, or out of 30, which is what it says on the actual submission report?  For regrade on assignment 8 should we just submit a regrade request on gradescope?\\xa0 Will the final exam have true/false questions or multiple choice? Looking at what I got points off for on a8, some of them were things that worked perfectly fine when I ran the program. Is there any way we can ask for a regrade request on it?\\xa0  In the answer for the removeObserver function, it has the return\\xa0type as DiceObserver, but it never returns any sort of DiceObserver.\\xa0Is this a mistake or does the remove function somehow return the DiceObserver automatically? And if it is a mistake, should we return the removed DiceObserver if a question like this were on the test, or do we just put the\\xa0return type\\xa0as void instead? Thank you!      on gradescope, our a8 grade is out of 60 but I remember it was out of 30 before we submitted it.     Does anyone know why line 7 of part a of the code eval question on the fall 2014 final is the same as the previous line?    In the Decorator Question for the sandwich problem the CheeseSandwich class is supposed to implement the Sandwich interface. This class does not include implementation for the isVegetarian() method... should this be corrected?      Also, on this same question, should we assume that there is a base class for Sandwich that that is already created because how would we call the addCheese or addBacon\\xa0methods with a Sandwich parameter if there is no base Sandwich to use?  Does anyone know where a practice problem for writing the Iterator design pattern would be?\\xa0  The answer keys for the last question (about MVC) say;      8. View registers as an observer of model components   Should this not be Controller?      9. Model notifies view components of changes   Should this also not be Controller?           The Decorator Key for the Decorator example on Sakai has classes extending the interface customSandwich... how is this possible? I thought that classes could only implement interfaces.  In the event that there is a curve on the final exam, will the same curve apply to the alternate exam for those who can&#39;t take the final exam tomorrow or will there just be no curve at all?\\xa0 I forgot to add one line of code for A8 that made the JOptionPane for the price slider appear, would there be any way to update this to my assignment? Pretty much the exact same line appears later for ingredient sliders, I just completely blanked for the price sliders. Thanks! how do we know if we have been approved for the alternate exam time? I sent in a request last week and haven’t heard back  This may have already been addressed, but do we need a Scantron or any other materials besides a pencil for the final?  What room is the final going to be in tomorrow? I&#39;ve looked everywhere, but can&#39;t seem to find\\xa0where it is going to be held.  How is D correct when we can have classes within classes (local and anonymous classes)?    In reference to C, does the subclass have to have a &#39;regular&#39; version of the method from the parent and then an additional version of the original that&#39;s overloaded (with different parameters)? Because if there wasn&#39;t one with the same signature from the parent class, Java would say it&#39;s not being extended, right?       Shouldn&#39;t A be correct?       Is B a reference to the old version of MVC where controller isn&#39;t the middleman? Should we not be basing our answers off the newer one that we learned more about?       I can&#39;t figure out the last two problems in Part II part c. I drew connections between the interfaces and classes and don&#39;t see how a class B can connect to InterA or class D.      Does anyone know when we will find out: a) if our request to attend the alternate final exam time is granted, b) where the alternate exam will be?  1. &#34;A method&#39;s signature is defined by its return type and the sequence of types associated with its parameters.&#34; Why is this one true? Does a signature include return type?      2. &#34;Casting a reference to an object from a subclass type to a parent class type is an example of contravariance.&#34; Why is this one false? If this is not contravariance, is this one an example of covariance.\\xa0      3.&#34;A composite object can claim to implement any interface associated with its components by employing delegation.&#34; Why is this one true?      4.&#34; If a catch block is provided for the Exception parent class, it should appear first before any other catch block.&#34; Why is this one false?      I would be really appreciated if you can help me with any of the above questions. Thank you! public Person[] findPeopleInBMIRange(double min_bmi,  double max_bmi) {  ArrayList people_in_range = new ArrayList();  for (BMIPerson p : people) {  if ((p.getBMI() &gt;= min_bmi) &amp;&amp;  (p.getBMI() &lt;= max_bmi)) {  people_in_range.add(p.getPerson());  }  }  return people_in_range.toArray(new Person[0]);  } }  For this part of the decorator question, why is the returned array an array of length 0? To my understanding, there should be multiple people who can be in the range. I&#39;m going back though all the lecture slides and saw HashMap and Map mentioned. I haven&#39;t heard it be referenced in lecture or recitation so would this be something we should study? Thanks         Why is the last statement here illegal? I understand that e1 was casted into a C object but an E object should still have the method that it needs in order for it to be a InterfaceB so why isn&#39;t this declaration legal?  In the decorator example, it says to create a class called SandwichCustomizer with the following methods:\\xa0         static Sandwich addCheese(Sandwich s)      static Sandwich addBacon(Sandwich s)         why does the answer create static methods with two parameters instead of just one?         static Sandwich addCheese(Sandwich s, boolean toast)      static Sandwich addBacon(Sandwich s, boolean toast)              In the Fall 2014 final, the answer for the Observer/Observable question has this interface:      interface DiceObserver {     observeDicePair(DicePair dp); }   So, the update() (aka observeDicePair()) method takes in a DicePair object and then calls dp.getDie1 and dp.getDie2:         public void observerDicePair(DicePair dp) {     detectDoubles(dp.getDie1(), dp.getDie2()); }               But would it be fair to make the update take in two dice integers?:   interface DiceObserver {     observeDicePair(int die1, int die2); }   Then, have the update() method just use the integers it&#39;s given without calling dp.getDie1 or dp.getDie2:         public void observerDicePair(int die1, int die2) {     detectDoubles(die1, die2); }          Hope this makes sense. Just wondering if both answers are totally fine or the first one is correct/better/more fine.  Will we be provided the ArrayList cheat sheet that&#39;s at the bottom of the Observable/Observer example?\\xa0  Does anyone know how to work through part a of the code eval for the fall 2014 final?   So if we were to be tasked with writing codes for Observer/Observable design pattern, do we have to write the code to add the observer to the observable in our constructor? Or should we just create the addObserver() method and leave it there like on the review session that we had?  Does anyone know how to work through part a of the code eval on the spring 2014 final?         Can anyone explain the difference between these two things?  Since there aren&#39;t any code-writing practice questions posted for it, can we assume that there will only be concept questions related to Iterator on the final?  Hi! I&#39;m a bit confused about the answer to the sandwich decorator problem. The cheese / bacon sandwich classes both extend the custom interface, but I thought only interfaces could extend other interfaces, not classes? Also, if the class is extending an interface, wouldn&#39;t the toasted and sandwich fields be inherited so they should not be redeclared?\\xa0  In the Fall 2014 final exam, it says that the statement &#34;the view component can be an observer of state changes within the model component&#34; is true. The question was regarding the MVC design pattern, where the model and view should not know anything about each other, as it&#39;s all the controller job.\\xa0 Is this a mistake on the exam, or is it a technicality where they can know about each other, but they shouldn&#39;t.  Can someone please explain the general concepts of threading? How much will we need to know about it for the exam?  The class Dog declared this enum as private:   private enum TailPosition {TAIL_LEFT, TAIL_RIGHT};   But in classes Terrier and Beagle, the enum was used in the constructor:   super(name, TailPosition.TAIL_LEFT);   wouldn&#39;t this cause an error?\\xa0      Thank you  On exam 2018, I was wondering why the last one would not compile.\\xa0   Why is this question from the 2014 Final exam false? I thought that threads could only obtain one lock at a time?\\xa0         Thanks!   In the answer key for the Observer/Observable, how does the notifyObserver function iterates through the array if we never use addObservable and update the List?\\xa0  Yesterday I was unable to attend the review session. Is there anyway I could get access to a PowerPoint that was used or does anyone have notes they took that they wouldn&#39;t mind sharing? Thanks!  For the midterm on gradescope, the rubric for when points are deducted can only be seen if you made those mistakes. I think it would help (definitely for me) if the rubric was visible for all questions. Is that possible?  Will the answer to the Observer/Observable question be published? I didn&#39;t have enough time to write down the answer to it and check with my own.\\xa0      In what case would option c be false? I can&#39;t think of any examples where a getter is not associated with a specific instance field.  I&#39;m trying to make a study guide for the final exam.\\xa0 Would going through each lecture and studying those concepts and then doing practice exams for actual coding and debugging practice be a smart way to do this?\\xa0 Is there a certain cut off for stuff I should ignore or not worry about as much?  Will there be Java GUI/concepts from Assignment 8 on the final exam?  If   public class E extends C implements InterB {…}      why does   InterB ib2 = (InterB) ((C) e1); \\xa0\\xa0 is ILLEGAL and not LEGAL ????      The question is set up as follows:           Does anyone know the logic for the answers on Page 2, parts D (g = 7) and E (i[0] = 9)?\\xa0      When I first did the exam I assumed that I got how array memory works confused, but I manually typed in the code from the exam into Eclipse to study and it&#39;s returning all of the same answers I got on the exam (6 and 8), so now I&#39;m really confused.      Thank you!      (EDIT: I took Version B, forgot to mention!) On the surface, I understand the decorator, but there are some things that don&#39;t connect for me going from the slides to the practice written code. For example, in the slides it says that decorators always encapsulate an instance of the same interface they implement, but in the answer to the Fall 2014 final the decorator is written as : public class ConcreteBMIPerson implements BMIPerson {  Person p;  public ConcreteBMIPerson(Person p) {  this.p = p; } Is this considered the same because BMIPerson extends Person??? Also in the &#34;recipe&#34; for decorator on the slides the first step is implement - make a new class that implements the interface, but on the released exam it seems the first thing they did was create a new interface.   So at the end of the day, my real question is what process should we go about for &#34;planning&#34; a decorator?Can we collectively come together and group where practice stuff is by theme? There&#39;s way too many released everything for me to skim every time I want a practice problem. I was hoping we could be like design pattern practice in 20--, 20--, and 20-- midterm released exam. Also are we allowed to make a google doc to study ?? &#64;Professor Does anyone know how to fix this error, a message says that this widget is disposable and will not let me commit my code. If anyone could help me, that would be great thanks.\\xa0  Why did professor put join() method in the TimerWidget class in lec22.v4 and a few other packages? I worked on A8 with my friend and we figured out the logic together . The syllabus says that we can report collaboration . How do we do that ?\\xa0 I am trying to implement plateview but for some reason I don&#39;t have any access to it&#39;s fields in order to handle updates and such.   My PlateView class extends JPanel. Below is the PlateView this variable in the debugger. If anyone can help I would greatly appreciate it.      My spoiled Scoreboard always stays at 0.0, even though my other Scoreboard works fine. I used a for loop to establish the ingr amount spoiled by taking a double variable\\xa0 and &#43;= each spoiled ingredients amount in Chef Impl.\\xa0 The double variable was then called in a for(Chef c: chefs) loop. Why is there never any change?  I have a couple drop down boxes and j sliders for part 2, but whenever I add a gold plate\\xa0the price is always $7.00 (even if I change it on the slider). anyone know why this might be happening?  Will partial credit be\\xa0given on A8 or is it an all or nothing type deal?  Under the Practice Question folder on Sakai, the Decorator practice question doesn&#39;t have a solution and the question is instead posted twice. Could someone fix this or put a solution up?  I know to make a scrollbar we need to use JScrollPane(), but where would we create that? Would it make sense to do one for each view we&#39;ve worked on, or is there one place we can put it that will encompass the whole window?  I already finished my belt view widget and made it convey the required information in &#34;A Better Belt View&#34; in a separate widget. Now that I finished that, is it fine if I leave the JLabel text for the plates to print the toString() information, or are we supposed to also change that information?  So I was under the impression that A7 would be looked at again if we submitted a regrade request and worked on fixing code style on that. Is that not acceptable?  How exactly should I go about giving the user a chance to add multiple ingredients to the roll? I guess I&#39;m saying that if they want multiple ingredients, then I am not sure how to make an option to add multiple ingredients. In my quest to make the game as personal as possible to distinguish it and excel expectations, I ended up exploring and using JavaSound, Image URLs, and more. I know we get points based on the overall quality of the program and each element described in the ReadMe, but do we lose points for doing too much?\\xa0 Although my program ran fine previously, now when I run it the application crashes and will not start. Does anybody know why it might do this?\\xa0 Is A8 graded for code style? did anybody see a Mac laptop charger in Sitterson? I think I left it in the lobby yesterday.\\xa0  When I submit my a8 assignment in gradescope, it says:      Source files found in submission: Compiling... error: no source files ... compiling done      Someone else posted a day ago asking this but it got marked as resolved without being answered, so i thought I would repost since I’m having the same issues.  Is there any way the A8 deadline will be pushed back? I realize that this has to be graded by hand but if we could have until Saturday night to submit that would be great!     I am wondering what means for the consumed and the spoiled food? I can&#39;t find a way to get the amount of consumed and spoiled food.  Are we allowed to resubmit a8 on gradescope?  Can we use JOptionPane instead of a Jslider or something to create the plate we want?  If i take a JList and select for multiple values, how do I account for each value and somehow create that into an ingredient object to create a roll? It seems really hard to create a roll if there aren&#39;t a set amount of ingredients to choose.\\xa0  For determining if a plate is at the position selected by the slider in PlayerChefView so it can be decided whether or not to place a plate there, how is it possible to determine if there is a plate there if the belt is not provided in the constructor. Should we be editing the PlayerChefView constructor to take in a belt as a parameter, or is there some other way to determine if a plate is at the position selected by the JSlider? I&#39;ve been stuck on this for a while and can&#39;t really figure it out. Thanks. I get the amount of plates eaten just fine, but for some reason when I get the amount spoiled, it either never changes or increases at the same time. I looked through both my code and the given code and I do not see anything wrong. It might be how I wrote my code, but that is the last problem that I can&#39;t seem to solve.   I am wondering how you guys are getting your spoiled amount. I&#39;ve been in office hours all day for the past two days and no one can seem to figure out why my plate that the player creates won&#39;t be added to the belt when the button is clicked. I called the make(color)PlateRequest method, I set action listeners, I set action commands. If anybody has any ideas please please let me know!!! You&#39;re saving a life if you do!!!  How would you add to the nearest position if there is already a plate if we don&#39;t have the parameters of the belt or plate in this class? Would we just create a new one and then do a for loop of the belt_size? Or is this code already performed somewhere else where we would need to call a method from?  Will the belt size change when the TAs are using our code?  How come when I change my JLabel array to a JButton array the color of the plates no longer shows in the background? All of my JButtons are set to the default color.  Whenever I create a scroll bar and add it to my panel it doesn&#39;t show up on my game? Does anybody know why?\\xa0        How do you add ingredients to a roll? For this part, should I create a slider for each ingredient?  What are the chances there will be a curve on the final exam? What does it mean by the amount of a plate ?Does it mean the sum of the amounts of each ingredient portion of a plate ?\\xa0 I hope I&#39;m not just being dumb but for the first part of assignment 8, is there a method that returns plate age for us? Or do we have to figure out how to count plate age ourselves in the belt view or something  Can anyone please explain what the placed nearest to any spot part means? &#34;so that it allows a player to create any kind of sushi on any color of plate and placed nearest to any spot on the belt.&#34;  Is there a priority of some sort for the different plate colors? I know the gold is for above $5.\\xa0 I saw previously on Piazza that A8 was due on LDOC at midnight, but on gradescope it says that it’s due April 27 at 10:00 am (Saturday). Which date is correct? Does anyone have a good way of getting the total ounces in a plate, if you don&#39;t know what kind of plate/sushi it is? I&#39;m working on the better scoreboard part of A8. I just don&#39;t know how to do this without making it complicated.  For A Better Belt view, I was planning on using a pop up window which would appear when a plate was clicked. However, I am just a little confused on how to implement this. Would I just have it so when the button is clicked, it calls the PlateViewWidget to make the pop up window? If so, I am also a little confused on how to make the JLabel Plates buttons.  Hi, I&#39;m working on the Better UI part of A8 and I&#39;ve created all the components that I need for the UI (combo boxes for plate color and sushi type, slider for position, more combo boxes for type of sashimi/nigiri, a check box for ingredients in a roll, and a slider for how much of each ingredient should be in a roll), but I can&#39;t figure out how to get it all to fit together.\\xa0 I&#39;m lost on what to do moving forward.\\xa0 Can anyone provide tips or help?      UPDATE: I&#39;ve been working on it more and I think I know that I need a lot of switch cases for plate color and sushi type and if statements for things like ingredients if the sashimi case is triggered, but I can&#39;t figure out how I would nest them or get them to run together.\\xa0 I&#39;m super lost.\\xa0 Can anyone help?  In the announcement sent in Sakai, it says we get 7 out of 10 points if we display:\\xa0      &#34;Type (Nigiri/Sashimi/Roll), chef who made it, and  price &#34;        but in the readme, it says:      &#34;the following information is conveyed in some reasonable way:    Color of the plate  Type of sushi (sashimi, nigiri, or roll)  If sashimi or nigiri, what kind.  If roll, the name of the roll, what ingredients and how much of each ingredient is included  The name of the chef who made the plate   The age of the plate &#34;       Do we display the age or the price?     Does anyone have any advice on how to get the plates that the player creates to go on the belt? I have created action listeners, and used the setActionCommand and getActionCommand method to see if the button was pressed but my plates still are not being added.\\xa0  For &#34;A Better Belt View,&#34; I created a ToolTipText hover function that just allows you to hover over the belt to see the details of a roll. Does this count as a widget?\\xa0Because most of the Piazza suggestions I see talk about making a widget by creating a class that extends JPanel, and that&#39;s way more complicated than what I did.      Under KMP&#39;s Github instructions, the guidelines are broad as to what counts as a widget (see quote below), so I\\xa0assumed it\\xa0counted\\xa0but now that I&#39;m about to submit I&#39;m having second thoughts.      &#34;You must develop some sort of &#34;plate view widget&#34; which is able to convey this information in a more interesting and elegant manner and modify BeltView to use your new widget instead of a JLabel&#34;  When I submitted my A8 assignment on the Gradescope, I got the following message on the screen:   Source files found in submission: Compiling... error: no source files ... compiling done   under &#34;Autograder Output.&#34;   Is this what I am supposed to see? I am worried because it says source files found first, but it also says no source files afterwards.  can anyone give some suggestions about how to start better scoreboard?   do we need to write extra classes like hightolowbalancecomparator?   thanks!  How do i get my\\xa0Code Style regraded? Does it have to be in person? or just re-submit my assignment?\\xa0  How is our attendance graded? Is there a number of\\xa0 maximum classed we are allowed to miss?  Is Friday the last day to submit regrade requests? I&#39;d been a little swamped with A8 so i hadn&#39;t had a chance to work on the code style until now.\\xa0 new Roll(&#34;test&#34;, new IngredientPortion[] {new AvocadoPortion(avocado_slider.getValue()/10), new CrabPortion(crab_slider.getValue()/10), new EelPortion(eel_slider.getValue()/10), new SeaweedPortion(seaweed_slider.getValue()/10), new ShrimpPortion(shrimp_slider.getValue()/10), new TunaPortion(tuna_slider.getValue()/10), new YellowtailPortion(yellowtail_slider.getValue()/10)}),position_slider.getValue());  This is what I have to try to make a new roll and obviously it doesn&#39;t work. The sliders are in integers 0 to 15 and I divided by 10, I realized that this wouldn&#39;t work because of the integer issue. The main problems is the 0.0 issue if the getValue is at zero. I don&#39;t have an idea on how to get over it. If we are using jsliders for getting the amount of each ingredient for the roll, how do you get the amount the user picks. I tried adding an action listener for the jslider, but it&#39;s not working for me.  can our plateviewwidget consist of jlabels and then the plateview widget is placed in the belt view? The only way I can see to really effectively recreate it is to use jlabels or something similar like text area, and this is already done in belt view so it seems incorrect to just move the implementation to a widget and pack the widget back into belt view. Im unsure of how strict the rules are for the plateviewwidget  I know this may be a stupid question but I just submitted a regrade request on gradescope but I haven&#39;t seen anything online to do anything else. Should I also resubmit my a7 code or do I have to have it done in person?  To prep for the final, I am going over what I got wrong on the midterm and one of those things is the primitive vs reference types in the question Part II: Code Understanding.   The int[] i and int[] j do not change values when they are called in foo but the int[]k and int[] l do change when they are called in foo.   The reason why k and l change makes a little sense because the int at the 0 index is being targeted and changed but I am confused as to why i and j don&#39;t change. An array is a reference type and foo is changing the value of the reference types which are stored in memory yet that doesn&#39;t change the values of i and j. Is this because they are arrays of ints? Or is there another explanation?   Thanks!  does anyone know how to add a scroll bar?  I created a\\xa0popup that appears where the user can set up their preferences for the\\xa0new plate, and a checkbox that, if selected, is supposed to handle the appropriate plate request. however, nothing is showing up on the belt even if I select the checkbox. I&#39;ve tried other options like a JButton or toggle button and am still having these same issues. I got a pink slip for 3 finals in 24 hours and I filled out the make up exam form when it was released. I was wondering if the make up exam has been scheduled yet or if I would have to schedule a time with KMP to take it. I just saw the announcement about us being allowed to just change the J-Label for A8 part 1. Does this mean that the 7/10 or higher will count as full credit? or should we make the plate view widget if we want the full 30 points for the assignment?\\xa0  I am wondering what should I use to enable users to\\xa0select price between 5.00 and 10.00. Can a slide to that? cuz I saw in a previous post that slider can only do integers. thanks!  What room will the final be given in?  Where do we turn in A8?  We have to give the player the ability to place the plate\\xa0nearest to any spot, so should I use a slider for this ability? What interval should I use for the slider? from 0 to belt size?  If I turn in A7 late will I have to complete the full assignment to receive half the points or will I just need to complete 50% of the assignment since I am already capped at that anyways.  Do we have to let the user be able to name the roll as well? or can it just be called random roll like the rest? public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) { \\t\\tswitch (e.getActionCommand()) { // mode code is here case &#34;sashimi&#34;: { \\t\\t\\tswitch (e.getActionCommand()) { \\t\\t\\tcase &#34;red_button&#34;: { \\t\\t\\t\\tsashimi_panel.add(avocado_button); \\t\\t\\t\\tsashimi_panel.add(crab_button); \\t\\t\\t\\tsashimi_panel.add(eel_button); \\t\\t\\t\\tsashimi_panel.add(shrimp_button); \\t\\t\\t\\tsashimi_panel.add(tuna_button); \\t\\t\\t\\tsashimi_panel.add(yellowtail_button); \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\tadd(sashimi_panel); \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\tsashimi_panel.setVisible(true); \\t\\t\\t\\tlisteners = new ArrayList(); \\t\\t\\t\\tsetFocusable(true); \\t\\t\\t\\trevalidate(); \\t\\t\\t\\trepaint(); \\t\\t\\t} \\t\\t\\t}  What I was hoping for the code to do is create a JPanel with buttons when the sushi type and the plate were chosen I haven&#39;t been able to make the code work and I am wondering if this would even work and if there is a better way of doing. I fill up the alternate final test require form because I have three exams at the same time. However, I do not know where and what time should I take the final exam.  Will A8 be graded for code style? Also, will it be submitted through gradescope?  I&#39;m torn between using a JTextField and a JSlider for the amount of each ingredient to include if the user is creating a roll. If I use a JSlider, I know the input will always be valid but the user will have less freedom in choosing ingredient amounts (they wont be able to pick .0384 for example). If I use a JTextField, then the user could pick any value and it&#39;d be easy to validate numerical inputs, but I think it would be a ton of work to deal with all of the possible invalid input such as\\xa0special characters, letters, etc.      I think I understand the design decision, I&#39;m just curious as to whether flexibility or safety will be weighted heavier in the grading.  I am trying to use a JSlider for the amount of an ingredient in a roll, but every time I try to it says that you can only use ints. Is there a way that I can still have a JSlider using a double as a max value or do I have to use a different Java Swing Component?\\xa0  How do I make the text of a button go on two lines instead of just one?\\xa0  What should we do if the user tries to make a roll with all the ingredients set to 0 oz? Should we throw an error or just ignore it and just not expect the user to do that. In a4 jedi we made sure that a roll had at least 0.1 oz of seaweed but that isn&#39;t implemented in the comp401 sushi code given to us in a8.\\xa0  For this part of the assignment, I&#39;m trying to make two dropdown menus. I managed to get the first one for plate colors but I don&#39;t know how to access the sushi types. Like should we make a dropdown menu\\xa0for rolls, sashimi and nigiri?\\xa0Anyone know how to go about this?   Also would we have to make each individual item (i.e crab sashimi, eel nigiri, etc.) or should we import\\xa0them from somewhere?\\xa0  When can we expect our grade request form to be processed if the autograder was messing up, and where should we look for that grade at?  Will we need to know Java Swing/GUI for the final? If so, how much?      The practice exams I&#39;ve looked at only feature one true/false question about Swing, so I imagine we won&#39;t be tested on this heavily. Am I right in assuming this?  I am confused on how to update refresh for a better belt view in order to get my Plate View Widget to update  In the &#34;a better belt view&#34; portion of the assignment, it says if the sushi is a roll then to say the name of the roll and what ingredients are included. I&#39;m confused because in the code we were provided (see screenshot attached), it seems like the rolls are just titled &#34;Random Roll,&#34; so is that the name of every roll?   I am trying to add in a dropdown list for the user to select how they want the scores to be ordered, but it is not displaying when I run the program. Is there any way to display the dropdown onto the scoreboard jlabel?  Will we be provided with the possibility of bringing our A8 code to office hours to have it graded, so we can fix any mistakes and have it regraded, or will grading only be done online?\\xa0  hi,   I am trying to add my plate view widget to my belt view widget.\\xa0   I try to make a new plate view widget but not sure what to put for the parameter(where the question mark is).   PlateViewWidget plate_view_widget =  new  PlateViewWidget(?);   in my plate view widget, it should be a plate. but I do not know what to put here cuz I am in the belt view class.   thanks!  I am working on the better view question and wondering how can I determine the sushi type. \\xa0I am thinking about using plate.getContents() but I realize the return of this method is a sushi object which needs further method to get the type of sushi but I am not sure how to do that. thanks  can anyone give me some advice on how to start a8?   I have already reviewed the lecture slides but the codes given for a8 are just too much and kind of overwhelming for me.   should I create a new widget for each plate to give the information asked?   thanks!  How should I account for the rotate function in my Belt View widget so it can in properly update the age/displaying the correct plate? Right now, if I click the rotate button and press on a plate all the plates that were in that position show up.\\xa0  How would you change the ingredients of each roll to string?  Is it the number of rotations, or how many times it has gone around the belt, or something else? I also do not know how I would track the age.  I was wondering what profit means in profitCounter. I am confused whether I am supposed to add to the profit if a plate is removed from the belt because it has been sold, or if I am supposed to subtract when a plate is removed.\\xa0  I was able to implement a plate view widget so that when you click on the belt, a new window appears\\xa0that&#39;s supposed to show the info for a particular plate. However, it&#39;s not registering when plates change because it always prints as &#34;empty plate&#34; and I can&#39;t figure out how to account for rotations in the code.    I am very confused on even how to start the assignment and how to use like JLabel and JButton. I know another post said that JLabel has .add, but I don&#39;t know how to properly use it.  My idea is to use a popup on the labels How do you submit for the regrade request for code style?    I tried to show the information of each individual plate by changing them to Buttons. But when I run it, it turns out &#34;NullPointerException&#34;. Is there anything in other classes that should have been changed if I want to use JButton? \\xa0  I&#39;ve written my plate view widget and I called it in the BeltView class but now nothing shows up in the game. The picture beIow is my BeltView constructor.          Is there a common call to make that makes everything show up either in the BeltView class or in my widget? I feel like I always forget those.   Thanks!  Does anyone know if this class has the 10 point grading scale or what grading scale it is using?  Will the slides from the last recitation be posted on Sakai? Does our code style grade count towards our HW avg.? KMP mentioned that we have to submit a regrade request, but there isn&#39;t one on gradescope.  If I\\xa0get above a 7/10, does that mean I\\xa0got a 100%?   Or should I resubmit until I get a 10/10?\\xa0    The assignment describes that we need to sort by **&#34; amount of food sold by weight order (highest to lowest)&#34;**  Does it refer to the number of plates consumed? or are we supposed to add the ingredients up and displays / sorts it, in ounces?    will the final exam be formatted like the midterm (true/false, code writing section, etc.) or something different?  Do we have any more recitations for the semester or was last Friday the last ones?  If our grade for code style grade in gradescope is marked &#34;ungraded&#34; does that mean that we did not get at least the 7/10 and need to keep working on our code style? or is code style still being graded? Will UI and MVC be topics that are covered on the final exam? And if so, will it be through true/false and MC or will we be required to evaluate and write code based on these concepts?\\xa0   For Assignment 8, are we only allowed to add certain specific functions that fulfills the requirements, or can we add &#34;whatever functionalities we want&#34; after these requirements were met?    I initially submitted my assignment without full comments and received a 10/10 in the autograder for the project. I then recceived less than 10 points for Code Style since my comments weren&#39;t complete. I finished my comments and went to resubmit, but saw a notice that I would only get 50% grade for the assignment being late if I now resubmitted. Can I resubmit for Code Style without losing the 10/10 I had for originally having the assignment submitted in time?  Can we continue to work on our code style after the deadline has passed?\\xa0  My JUnit tests for Adept won&#39;t work and it highlights\\xa0the &#34;problem&#34; in my ProfitCounter\\xa0 class but I can&#39;t figure out what the actual problem is.      Gradescope is not running, help I think it&#39;s overloaded.  My A7 shows an NoClassDefFoundError and i tried everything!    Are we allowed to use other components not covered in class such as JMenu in our code?    Well I did the mistake of writing my code as just files on my computer and folders with A1, A2, etc. So I didn&#39;t create them and put them in their repositories when making them. Now when I submit it through the autograder it messes up. How do i move my files from A1 into the repository for a1. I have no idea I might&#39;ve missed something from KMP&#39;s video but I can&#39;t submit anything right now. Does anybody know what to do??  If we used code style differently and submitted to gradescope\\xa0multiple times, will the one that&#39;s activated be graded?  I just finished A7 Adept and I have over half of the total points for A7. If I don&#39;t finish A7 Jedi before the deadline, will my final grade for A7 be capped at 50 points?  When I create a new JButton or Jframe using the examples from the lecture slides, I am unable to see the actual frame or button, but the java icon appears in my dock as if a java program is running, then closes shortly after.      The following is the code I am using:    import javax.swing.*;  public class MainClass {  \\tpublic static void main(String[] args) { \\t\\t \\t\\tFrame main_frame = new JFrame();  \\t\\tmain_frame.setTitle(&#34;Hello, World&#34;);  \\t\\tmain_frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE); \\t\\tJPanel main_panel = new JPanel();  \\t\\tmain_frame.setContentPane(main_panel); \\t\\t \\t\\tnew JButton(&#34;test&#34;); \\t}  }        I&#39;m a bit confused with the code styling for assignments. If we already had it checked at cohorts does that mean one of our assignments will still be graded?\\xa0 Do we need to comment the PlateEvent and BeltPlateException in A7 even though we did not have to do anything to them?     I am getting this error in the autograder and I am not sure why  I past all the test except for\\xa0 jedi test 2 and 4. Does anyone have any idea why this &#34;null&#34; occurred?   Test failed. null  If there is no main class how do we add both profit and plate counter into the observers list? In the lecture notes there was a main class to add the UNC and Duke fan as game observers.   I am passing the A6 JUNIT tests but whenever I submit my code in the auto grader I get this error  should Customer objects be stored in an array or a list?  My digital hand is not loading for me. What I mean is, it&#39;s been stuck on the loading screen for 30mins.         Since kmp gave us comp401sushi do we have to add comments into all of those explaining what they do for a7 for code style grading? Or do we just have to do all of the ones in the a7 folder? How many points off of our attendance grade is it if we missed a class?So just to be clear, if I have a 100 on A1-A6 already can a accept A7 and then go back later and style an earlier assignment? Could someone please explain what KMP meant by an IN grade granted due to a family emergency etc?      Thanks  I am trying to use set B now since all of my set A tests are passing, but I am confused about getCallCount and resetCallCount, since getCallCount is initialized to null I am getting null instead of 0 and it is not making it past those lines in my tests. How am I supposed to fix those to work?\\xa0 Can we get our code style graded this Friday during our recitation time? In test set b register customer twice test, neither .equals() nor == seem to catch two equivalent customers. is anyone else having this issue?  I got 10/10 in Assignment 5. But for A6, the gradescope told me the following error. Does anyone know why?   Output: Test failed. Illegal plate price  I&#39;m confused as to what handlePlateEvent is supposed to do. The implementations are to use PlateEvents using handlePlateEvent to perform their tasks but I&#39;m confused how this is supposed to all come together.  I&#39;m having a weird issue where I&#39;m able to pass the testProfitCounterExistingBelt and testPlateCounterExistingBelt tests, but I&#39;m failing the testGetAverage/Total and testPlateCount tests. For some reason on these tests my variables to count the profit and plate count aren&#39;t initializing correctly and register as 0. Why am I only having this problem with these tests?      I&#39;m getting this error in my A7 tests which prevents initialization when I run JUnit... When I uploaded my code to Gradescope, it passed 6 of my Adept tests but I get the feeling that the other Adept tests and this error in my JUnit tests may be because I accidentally changed\\xa0something in my code.  Maybe I&#39;m just missing something, but all of my imports are redlined. Not sure how to fix this problem :(       Quick fixes just say &#34;remove unused import&#34; or &#34;organize imports&#34;  For A6 Jedi, I have passed 3/5 test, but am having an issue with the tests for ColorFilteredIterator and PriceThresholdIterator. I believe the issue is in the hasNext()\\xa0 method for both, but this method works in my regular BeltIterator class as it passed all the test for adept.\\xa0   The only thing I changed was the if statement in the for loop making it this for the PriceThresholdIterator. (I have something similar for ColorFilteredIterator):\\xa0       if  (belt.getPlateAtPosition(start_position) !=  null  &amp;&amp;\\xa0belt.getPlateAtPosition(start_position).getPrice() &lt;= max_price)      any ideas on what I&#39;m doing wrong?    After A1-A7 are due, what assignments will be due before our exam? Do we still have the opportunity to complete one of them for extra credit?\\xa0  All of my tests are passing in Jedi except I&#39;m confused out how to notify the customers after the rotate method is called. Are we writing our own observePlateOnBelt method? Also how would you set up parameters for a notifyCustomers method when all of the plates are shifting?  So since A7 relies on imported code and kmp does not use camel casing - does that mean that I need to remove any camel casing in my code?\\xa0   Or can my code have camel casing as long as the part I have added are consistent?      Also, if I have A7 graded for code style, since it relies on imported code, is A6 also graded, since the encapsulated code is different?     I have had my A6 assignment graded for code style at office hours already. Should I expect to have my A7 code style graded as well? Would I have to come to office hours to do this or would be it be done through the gradescope submission? When are office hours? I have all assignments done except A7, but haven&#39;t finished code styling for all of them. With the restrictions on accepting A7, will I be able to go back and upload changes to my code after I accept A7 or is that still not allowed? Thanks Is A7 definitely going to be due on April 12? I had finished it a while ago but now have a lot of debugging to do and only 3-4 days to do it since the autograder/JUnit tests were released Mon. night which seems crammed, especially with midterms this week. What&#39;s the deadline for code style grading?  I had my code style graded in the last recitation but there is no gradescope category for it nor does it appear in the sakai gradebook. I believe this is normal but would just like to double check in case there was an error and it wasn&#39;t recorded. Thank you! Where can I find the JUnit tests for the autograder? Hi guys, Im\\xa0attempting to submit my a4 because i hadnt before. My code is passing almost all the JUNIT\\xa0tests but when i submit it to gradescope, it only going through the classes with the junit tests in them, and consequently giving me 0 points. How do I fix this?         edit: got it to work, just had to remove the package with the tests  When the A7 Jedi description says &#34;Now modify  BeltImpl  so that after a rotation occurs, all registered customers are notified if there is now a plate at the customer&#39;s position by calling the customer&#39;s  observePlateOnBelt  method,&#34; what does a rotation mean?\\xa0 Does it just mean after the rotate() method is called or does it mean something else?  So i got through novice, and did my attempt at adept, but when I submitted it to the autograder, it said &#34;The autograder failed to execute correctly. Contact your course staff for help in debugging this issue&#34; and I&#39;m just wondering what thats about.  I am confused about how to register belt observers in the addBeltObserver and removeBeltObserver methods: how do we make a plate event object to pass through (How do we know which plate to pass in and which position inside the methods)?     In the A6 Novice tests a piece of nigiri and sashimi are initialized:      nigiri = new Nigiri(NigiriType.CRAB);     sashimi = new Sashimi(SashimiType.EEL);\\xa0      but the tests cant access the NigiriType and SashimiType. However in the A6 Adept and Jedi Tests as well as the A5 tests the pieces of nigiri and sashimi are initialized differently and don&#39;t give me an error:      nigiri = new Nigiri(Nigiri.NigiriType.CRAB);     sashimi = new Sashimi(Sashimi.SashimiType.EEL);      Since I can&#39;t change the test code how can i make Nigiri and Sashimi classes visible to the Novice unit tests?   \\xa0           My JUnit Tests come back with the error &#34;Index 2 out of bounds for length 0&#34;. I have declared my plate array like: Plate[] plateArray = new Plate[belt_size];\\xa0      What is wrong\\xa0with this? I went back in to fix minor problems that caused me to lose points on A2 and A3  before starting A7 (I misspelled vegetarian), but now the autograder is giving me an error where it says the main class cannot be found. Also I can no longer push and commit changes to github for either assignment. I&#39;m working on A7 adept, and I can&#39;t figure out how to implement the handle plate event. I have a notify method so that the observer classes know when to make a change, but how do I get the getTotalBeltProfit and average profit methods to change according to the new additions/removals to the belt?  I&#39;ve tried to test my a7 with the JUnit but I&#39;m just getting all NullPointerExceptions for all the tests....My code itself seems like it should work. The error is getting thrown when the test begins.   ex. &#96;public void testConstructors()&#96;   All of my class names are spelled correctly, i have no idea whats going on.\\xa0   thanks  I got a lot of test failures when I tried to use the JUnit test for Assignment 7, where my returned values were 0 when something else was expected. I tried to use the debugger, but I ended up in a place in which the JUnit library was referenced and it said that the &#34;Source was not found.&#34; How\\xa0could\\xa0I fix this issue?  there&#39;s one line of code that won&#39;t work for me for A7AdeptTestSetA - specifically line 99. It suggests to &#34;configure build path&#34; and I&#39;ve tried to fix it here, but it&#39;s still underlined in red and I can&#39;t run the test to try and fix my own code.\\xa0  Since A6 encapsulates all the work done in A4 and A5, do we have to worry about having our code styled in the A4 and A5 projects, or can we just have it styled in A6 to save time copy/pasting changes from one project to another?  Hi, I just submitted by A7 for the first time and every test except for A7 Jedi Set B Test 1, 3, and 4 all failed and simply said &#34;null.&#34;\\xa0 Is there any way I can get more feedback or fix this easily?\\xa0 It seems odd that all of my tests would fail and all say null.  When I try to follow the link given at sakai, the github shows that no page found.\\xa0  When is the deadline for getting our code style graded?  I know these questions have already been asked but no one is answering.      When will the A7 autograder be up? if it is due Friday I&#39;d really like to know if my code is correct.   Will JUnit tests be released for A7?      Finally, is it just A5-7 that is going to be graded for style?  I have similar errors to other students where the github page for a4 is not opening, but it does not show up in my repositories to be deleted, does anyone know how to fix this so I can upload my work?  I ran all the J-unit tests for A6 and they passed, but when I went to submit it in the autograder something caused everything to fail. I can&#39;t figure out why this is happening.\\xa0  Hello, I keep getting an error for my Adept 3 test and I&#39;m not sure what its saying. Does this mean there is an issue with my entire class or how I set it up?\\xa0     When will the autograder be released?  I pass all the A6 autograder tests except Adept test 3. I have seen other posts about adept test 3 not working. Is there an issue with the autograder? I could not find any errors in my code  Did we use the same lecture slides (lecture slides 20) for both the lectures on Tuesday and Thursday?     I&#39;m stuck and can&#39;t figure out a4 Jedi:      the idea is that if I have salmon1, tuna1, rice1, salmon2, salmon3, tuna2, seaweed1   copy these elements into an ArrayList      i will start with the first element in the arraylist and combine all the common elements of that element, add those combined elements to a new arraylist and then remove the element at the first index and repeat process      I will end up with an arraylist with combined elements salmon1salmon2salmon3, tuna1tuna2, rice1, salmon2salmon3, salmon3, tuna2, seaweed         edit: old code was way to complex figured it out after using a specific arraylist method      then i will make another array that removes the multiple occurring elements by storing the indexes of the recurrences and then removing those indexes from the array and I will be left with salmon1salmon2salmon3, tuna1tuna2, rice1, sea      why does this not work?      edit: Figured it out, old code was way to complex..kept it simple with the set arrayList method The grade scope kept saying null but idk what’s wrong with my code. I initialized an object for each of my class so that shouldn’t be the problem. I can&#39;t get hasNext to work. I think it&#39;s because my\\xa0\\xa0belt.getPlateAtPosition always returns null but I don&#39;t know why it does that because getPlateAtPosition passes its test. Does anyone know why this might be happening?   Thanks.  I&#39;m having a lot of trouble creating logic that works for rotate().\\xa0 It seems like the way I implement it, rather than moving plates it just replaces them as it goes through the array.\\xa0 Can anyone provide a better way to do it?      Update:\\xa0 Figured it out.\\xa0 Was changing positions from bottom of array rather than top.  Which assignments exactly are going to be looked at for the code style grade? Can we choose which assignments we want to show?      Also can we make code style changes on other assignments after accepting A7?  Do we need to comment code for simple getter/setter methods?      Also on a1, a2 do we need to comment what we are storing when our variableName practically does that for us?      It&#39;s confusing because the style guide also says don&#39;t over comment.      In my mind, if the variable name makes the code obvious than i shouldn&#39;t comment.      ex. itemName = scan.next() is self-explanatory or do I need to comment //Stores item name ?      thanks.  I&#39;m stuck on\\xa0how we&#39;re supposed to try and implement handlePlateEvent() for this assignment, especially when it comes to trying to deliver plateEvent objects to the observer. I thought we would use a notifyObserver() method but that doesn&#39;t seem like it&#39;s part of the assignment.  Remember that recitation is only in FB 007 today! (if anyone is in the other room and confused where everyone is)  So I am currently passing three of the Adept tests (testFullBelt, testNoElementNext, testHasNext), but I&#39;m having trouble locating my problem in next...\\xa0   I currently have the code attached, and it is giving me an assertion error, saying that it returned null rather than the expected reference. I believe my problem might be in my constructor— right now I only have the instantiation of my objects but I don&#39;t know if I should include some sort of for loop to reinitialize the belt once it reaches null...? How do we make the code loop around?                I didn&#39;t notice the A7 announcement that I should finish all the homework before, and I haven&#39;t submitted any homework. I was shocked when my friends told me about the A7. Is there any solution to deal with it? Please help me with it.  Is code style going to be graded through grade scope or do we have to go into office hours personally to get it checked? Also, will that be averaged with our assignment grades or does it count for something else?  If I have a conflicting event during my recitation time slot, would I be able to attend a different recitation class and still submit an attendance form?  When will A7 Tests be released?  Hi all,    Has anyone else gotten the illegal plate price error for A6. I only have gotten through novice so far, but I got this error for like all of them. Thanks  The Junit test for A4 show i have no errors or failures, but the autograder\\xa0gives me 3/10\\xa0  Does anyone know why this class requires instructor consent? The other 411 section overlaps with the only 410 section. I have three exams on one day and I was wondering if anybody knows the exact date for the make up exam so I do not reschedule this exam and it ends up being during one of my other exams. Can someone provide some insight as to how they implemented this method? Did you use the setPlateAtPosition method and a try catch block?\\xa0  I am kind of confused about how to register or unregister customer.   should be establish a new array list and set the customer to specific position?   thanks!    How my code is now will only work with one of the two, if next works, the beltiterator stops working and vice versa.  I asked the ta s and they did give me good advice, but it is messy from all of their suggestions.  Any advice will help.  edit: got it fixed after going to OH, it would been easier to shown the code, but didn&#39;t want to. I accepted A7 and received a link for it, but when I click on it I get a error 404. How do I fix this?\\xa0  Should constructors follow the same comment guidelines as other methods? (i.e. detailing input, output, error conditions)  So I was trying to do A6 for the longest time and kept getting this one thing wrong. Its test 3 from Adept, and I took a look at it and think it might be structured wrong.    It has two iterators, one starting from 0 and another starting from 2. It calls next one time before hand on the from0 iterator to attempt to &#34;sync&#34; up the next commands.      However, I don&#39;t think this would work unless you added one more next call, to which I even modified the autograder to have one more next call on the from0 iterator and it actually does work.   The logic is this:      starting at from0:      from0 starts at position 0 (null) -&gt; autograder calls next, serves plate at position 1 -&gt; autograder calls next, serving plate from position 2 -&gt; autograder asserts that this result will equate to from2 next call      however the logic for from2 goes:      from2 starts at position 2 (plate) -&gt; autograder calls next,serving plate from position 3      So the from2 iterator&#39;s next function serves the plate from position 3, while the from0&#39;s next function serves plate from position 2      Basically this is how I believe the code sees things      from0: 0 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 2   from2: 2-&gt; 3   2 != 3      I think this problem arose from how arrays start at 0, since I think it might&#39;ve been intended for from0 to start at plate 1, which was at position 1. But from0 starts at the &#34;first&#34; position on the belt, which is 0. Please let me know what you guys think.        Why does this code ask me to cast the return object as Plate when the method already returns plate in both Plate next() and getPlateAtPosition()? It says cannot convert from a6.plate to plate.   Reposted from Sakai announcements:      &#34;The start up repository for this assignment contains a solution for parts of prior assignments.   Do not click on this link to accept the assignment if you are still working on prior assignments. Once you have accepted A7, any subsequent submissions for prior assignments may be ignored or discounted. Looking at the starter A7 code and using it to complete prior assignments may be considered an honor code violoation.&#34;     \\xa0   We&#39;ve already had a couple people accept A7 without finishing their previous assignments who haven&#39;t been able to go back and finish their older assignments. The LAs aren&#39;t sure yet how we&#39;ll handle those cases but please\\xa0 only accept A7 if you\\xa0are  completely  done with your previous assignments.\\xa0      I&#39;ve seen others referencing running the given JUnit test for assignments to diagnose problems in A5/A6 but I can&#39;t for the life of me find where they are.  Hi! Someone left a blue/brown/green/white umbrella in the OH room today between 3 and 4. If this is yours, we put it on the top shelf of the back wall!    Should we add comments for methods in a class that implements an interface? More specifically, should we add extra comments for methods in a class if we&#39;ve already made comments in its parent interface? * * * For instance:  If we have an interface:     public interface Iinterface {     // this method is intended to create a new method     void newMethod(); }    and we have a **class** that implements this interface:    public class Iclass implements Iinterface{     &#64;Override     public void newMethod() { \\treturn;     } }    Should we add comments to this method in this class? Or should we just write the **(non-Javadoc) &#64;see package.Iinterface#newMethod()**?         when will the auto-grader for a7 be available on gradescope?   will there be a j unit test available as before?   thanks!  Because the a7 starter code includes classes from previous projects, do we need to go through and comment for the code-style grade? Or do we only have to comment on new classes/interfaces we create?  So I have three finals within a 24 hour period, if I submit an exam excuse for this final would I have to take it earlier or later than April 30th?\\xa0  I&#39;m confused about how the modified remove method is supposed to have the information to know that next() hasn&#39;t been called or that remove() have been called a second time before next()?  In\\xa0Gradebook on Sakai my midterm curved score is based on my raw score, but out of 100 (not 98, because of the dropped question). Is this a mistake?  When I tested out my code (I made my own tests based off the JUnit Tests), it throws the PlatePriceException error when it encounters a price less than the corresponding plate&#39;s price.\\xa0 However, Gradescope is still displaying this for each plate:       I created tests specifically using the price 0.605 and the tests throw the error just fine... how do I get that to translate to Gradescope?  is there any possibility that anyone knows the maximum percentage of our total score that we can get for extra credit assignment if there is one? cuz I really screwed up my midterm due to various reasons and really trying to make up to it if there is an extra credit assignment to take advantage of. thanks a lot.     For a4, do we need to add comments in each individual sub class of Ingredient/IngredientPortion class or can we just write it in our IngredientImpl/IngredientPortionImpl? Or, do we write comments in the interface (like a6&#39;s Belt Interface)? I know i&#39;m a little late to the party, but are we supposed to create our own instance variables to pass through to the superclass? More specifically, with AvocadoPortion, do I need to create an Avocado object to pass through the constructor?  Thanks for the help!I am wondering how to write the if statement for the hasNext because how I am writing, it is not hitting the if statement. \\t\\tif (belt.getPlateAtPosition(start_position&#43;&#43;) != null) { \\t\\t\\treturn true; \\t\\t} else if (belt == null) { \\t\\t\\treturn false; \\t\\t} else { \\t\\t\\treturn false; \\t\\t} Are the A6 test cases posted somewhere or we have to write our own test cases?\\xa0    \\xa0  This was one of the test for testBeltConstructor and I wasn&#39;t sure what to do with the negative number  I tried to use absolute value to turn the negative into positive, but the JUnit changed from error to failure.  Thanks I’ve seen a number of people come into office hours with values that are a decimal or two off when it comes to the getProfit( ) test. Often the issue is not in getProfit itself but in a method it is calling. This is the perfect instance to try and use the debugger! While we are happy to help in office hours, it is good practice to try and use the debugger on your own to learn by doing it yourself.\\xa0     A couple of people have asked questions about rounding for getCalories( ) and getCost( ), and I&#39;ve followed the tips given on Piazza but mine is still not rounding up. It seems like no matter what I do, calories come out to 31 instead of 32, and cost comes out to 1.0 instead of 1.25.\\xa0 Am I misunderstanding?  In Part IV of the midterm, one of the requirements states that &#34;Happiness is a property of a Person object&#34;. If you had COMP110 with Kris Jordan, he used the word property to define a field. Seeing the word property, I calculated happiness in the constructor and set the result to a field. I got points off since I created a field for happiness which I only did since I saw the word property. It seems that this wording punishes students who specifically took COMP110 with Kris Jordan. For reference, here is Kris Jordan&#39;s slides on properties:\\xa0   comp110.com/topics/object-oriented-programming/properties     I think it would be important for future tests to not use property in cases like this.   I&#39;ve been working on A4 Jedi for a few hours now and I am completely lost, I&#39;ve tried multiple things but so far I have made no progress.\\xa0 Can anyone explain what process they used to get it to work?      EDIT:\\xa0 The main thing I&#39;ve focused on is utilizing an ArrayList that will be added to from the array given to the constructor.\\xa0 However, I believe I am getting stuck with the logic behind how to populate and use the ArrayList in order to solve Jedi.  since our belt is an array(at least mine is), how are we supposed to remove an element out of it?   because I know that there is a remove method for array list but I am not sure how to do it with array.   Why might this code in the beltiterator class produce a stack overflow error at the while line?  For my getCalories() method, when I add all of the calories up, it rounds down rather than up so my result is always off by 1 (ex: expected 32 got 31) ...\\xa0 how can I fix this?  In the most recent announcement, KMP said we should be able to cancel regrade request for the &#34;fix the bug&#34; question, but Gradescope won&#39;t let me cancel my regrade request. I changed the comment to say that I didn&#39;t want it regraded; is that sufficient? Is there a setting in Gradescope that can be changed to allow us to cancel regrade requests?  I got the\\xa0question that stated &#34;All methods in Java are virtual&#34; correct on the exam. However, upon taking that question off of the rubric, my grade ended up lower than before. For those of us that studied using the slides posted by KMP to the sakai site, it explicitly stated in the lecture 10 slides that all methods in Java are virtual. Furthermore, it was pretty heavily implied that the question was pertaining to non-static and non-final methods, or else the question would be essentially meaningless. Will those of us that got it right originally from what KMP told us be given back those 2 points, so we are all equally rewarded rather than those who got it wrong rewarded and those who got it right having lower grades? Thanks!  Hi all! So I&#39;m working on A4 and have everything working except for the final test, Jedi Test 3. Basically, here&#39;s what I&#39;m getting:   Output: Testing if roll constructor detects that enough seaweed is in ingredients Test failed. expected:&lt;104&gt; but was:&lt;109&gt;   I&#39;m confused as to why it isn&#39;t working. The way I check if a wrapper has been included is by first creating a boolean variable initialized to false (lets call it hasWrapper). I then loop through all the given IngredientPortion objects and test to see if its .getName() method return &#34;seaweed&#34; AND .getAmount() &gt;= 0.1. If so, then it updates hasWrapper to true. At the end, if hasWrapper is false, it adds a new SeaweedPortion object that has 0.1 ounces as its parameter. I wrote test code to and it appears to work for all the cases I can think of. If there&#39;s already seaweed whose amount equals or exceeds 0.1, it doesn&#39;t add another SeaweedPoriton. Otherwise, it adds the expected SeaweedPortion. Does anyone have any ideas about what could be going on? My first instinct was maybe since amount is a double, there&#39;s some tolerance I need to include as in a way I&#39;m testing for equality with the &gt;= operator, however this proved not the be the case when I tried adding some tolerance. I appreciate any help!  is April 12th the deadline for assignment 1-7 or assignment 1-8?    How should we compare if two customers are the same? Should we use the **customer.equals(Object o)** or the **==**?    I have finished A7 and is a bit confused about the Jedi part. Is it the case that we do not need to write any class that explicitly implements interface Customer?  After accepting A7, can we resubmit previous assignments fixing code style, just not changing code? Or do all the other assignments need to be completely done before accepting? Is there any reason why the TA&#39;s were not allowed to answer &#34;wording related&#34; questions on the midterm? Some of the syntax was convoluted and difficult to understand.  I was clueless as to what some of the questions were asking for.  This is the first exam throughout both high school and college where I have had instructors refuse to answer syntax related questions.  Not very fair in my honest opinion.I ran my programming through the JUnit and got everything working except the gold plate and I checked over my code and it got caught on the fail(&#34;Should have thrown IllegalArgumentException&#34;); But this line is above the catch line  fail(&#34;Should have thrown IllegalArgumentException&#34;); \\t} catch (IllegalArgumentException e) { After moving the fail below the catch, I got it working. I am wondering if there is an issue with the autograder if it is using the JUnit to grade the code. Can anyone explain why the instance fields in PersonImpl should be declared as private double since the catPersonImpl class would extends this class.  Can someone post the slides from today so we can go over the solutions slower?  will there be any extra credit opportunities before the semester is over?\\xa0 Do we have curve on midterm&#xff1f; Hello, I have a quick question in regards to coding style. Say you have an interface (MyInterface). Let&#39;s say you also have a parent class (ParentClass) that implements MyInterface and a subclass that extrends ParentClass called SubClass.   When writing SubClass, which would be considered the proper form:   public class SubClass extends ParentClass    or:   public class SubClass extends ParentClass implements Interface   It is my understanding that either are technically correct since SubClass is a ParentClass and thus automatically implements Interface, but which is considered to be the best style? I appreciate the help!        All of my a6 adept j-unit tests are passing except for the &#34;testBeltIterator&#34; one. When I click on the test failure, it takes me to the line that says:\\xa0       assertEquals (from_0.next(), from_100.next());      What could\\xa0be causing this to fail? I keep looking over my Belt Iterator class and everything seems to be set up correctly, and the hasNext and next tests are passing, so I&#39;m wondering if anyone else is having this problem too.\\xa0  Whenever I try to push to GitHub, I get the error &#34;rejected. non-fast forward&#34; and it won&#39;t accept my code. Does anyone know how to fix this?\\xa0 For the testBeltIterator() in the A6Adept JUnit test, the last few lines of the method test the syncing of from_0 and from_2.  Why does calling from_0.next() one time sync it with from_2 -- shouldn&#39;t from_0.next() be called twice instead of once to align from_0 and from_2?  If I called it twice in the JUnit test instead of one time, then it passed the test, so are there any suggestions on how I can fix my code to pass the test the way it is written (so correctly align the from_0 and from_2 iterators)? All the other tests, including inside testBeltIterator(), worked. The last submission I sent to the autograder it gave me a 9/10, everyone other than the 3 jedi tests were correct. Then, I resubmitted after ONLY changing the code in my A3Jedi file, and now it says all 3 jedi tests are good but every other test comes back as incorrect. All of them show this error:\\xa0    the autograder says it has compiled all the files from A3 and that it isn&#39;t missing any, but this keeps happening. Anyone know what&#39;s going on?  when writing setPlateAtPosition method for novice, I am confused about the parameter for BeltPlateException. I know it should be (position, plate, Belt), but I do not know what to put for belt cuz I constructed BeltImpl as an array.  I&#39;m working on a6 adept, and I&#39;m passing my all of the J-Unit tests except for testRotate and testBeltIterator. From my testBeltIterator error, I think that there&#39;s something wrong with my iteratorFromPosition method. Right now it&#39;s returning the belt iterator object:\\xa0      Iterator&lt;Belt&gt; iter =  new  BeltIterator( this , normalizedPosition);      Can anyone tell me why this would be causing a test failure?  Whenever I try to run anything on Eclipse, it gives the error message\\xa0   &#34;Error occurred during initialization of boot layer   java.lang.LayerInstantiationException: Package jdk.internal.jimage in both module java.base and module jrt.fs&#34;      I know that the code I am running works because it passes the auto grader, but Eclipse always gives this error. At the recommendation of some ULAs, I&#39;ve tried changing the version of Java being used, but that doesn&#39;t help. Any ideas how I can fix this?

While adapting your code for the Jedi part of a6, I am very unsure about how to make sure next() has already been called before the remove() method can be called.  I&#39;m unsure of what this error means when I test my A6 Novice. Does anyone know?   Output: Test failed. a6.BeltImpl.&lt;init&gt;(I)V  Are we supposed to be using an ArrayList instead of an array to store the plates on the belt in A6? All of my novice tests are passing when I use the normal array, but I can&#39;t figure out how to use circular indexing on the hasNext() method to get the program to recognize when the list is empty.  I&#39;m struggling to understand how to get all the input into MenuItemImpl and IngredientPortionImpl objects, can anyone explain how they went about storing it all?  hi,   I just imported a5 test class but when I open the file, it is like this and I do not know what to do about it.   hi,   I got all the test results null for a5 and I do not know why. does anyone have had a similar situation?   thanks!    I&#39;ve been getting Illegal Plate Price error in my A6 Novice, but I don&#39;t\\xa0see anything related to price in this Novice instruction? Is there something wrong with my A5 then? But I passed it with a 10/10.\\xa0   Thanks    Are we allowed to add methods to the Belt Interface? (such as a method that returns the plate array in the belt object)    I&#39;m working on A6 adept and I&#39;m confused about the setPlateToNearestPosition method. How do I get it to continue to loop through my array of plates and stop once it sees that there is an empty spot on the belt?    We still have some people who will need to take the midterm next week. Please don&#39;t discuss the exam until we have announced it is OK to do so.  besides inheritance  Could someone please explain question a and b? I got 100 for both questions.\\xa0      Is Java UI going to be on the midterm?I&#39;ve been getting mixed signals.  Midterm.PNG    I reached the red bubble and I thought that it would throw an ExB and therefore be uncaught because while ExB is a RuntimeException, RuntimeException isn&#39;t an ExB?      However, the midterm answer was 1 which I&#39;m guessing was because it was caught in the RuntimeException and returned a 2 which is then subtracted by one in the finally body.      Why was it caught in the RuntimeException block this time when RuntimeException isn&#39;t an ExB or is it being caught outside of the bar method?  maybe you\\xa0aren’t allowed to answer it, maybe it’s a dumb question, but will we be expected to write\\xa0something like 2014 Final FRQ (obs/observable)?  &#34;Which of these are valid variable names in Java?   d) AVar_&#34;      I thought variables weren&#39;t supposed to start with a capitalized letter.\\xa0  Any chance we can have access to the midterm review ppt code on github or some sort? It&#39;s just easier to see the design patterns esp for decorator.\\xa0        What&#39;s the benefit of including a method in the interface by using the default keyword?\\xa0  I went to office hours for this one and tried it with two UTAs and both times got 1 as the answer instead of -2. Can any explain how to get -2?\\xa0  question:\\xa0 https://drive.google.com/file/d/1njKB6xTVHi5QlVlqOXrmydMe2aHCTzyE/view \\xa0   answer:\\xa0 https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qz91kxUpbv0DPxjO19SDMALm9Cywm9G4nQeX7g3qohM/edit       On the answer for this free response, it says that AbstractSandwich is a public abstract class. Why is it abstract if there are no abstract methods?\\xa0Is this because we don&#39;t want there to be any instantiated objects?\\xa0Also, are the fields protected because the subclasses need to access these when calling super?  Why is the answer for foo(3) that the exception is not caught? I thought with the catch or specify rule, if the method states that the Exception is thrown, it should be fine.\\xa0    Why does this not compile? Isn&#39;t this similar to the example below in which a c obj being cast to a b object still calls the c objects method? Is it because even though it would access the C class&#39;s m2 method the m2 method in B is not defined for 3 integers? This is the only difference I can see between to the two examples. Thank you in advance         Question 8 says &#34;A variable can be assigned the result of any expression&#34; and the answer key says this statement is false.   Why is this the case?  So I didn&#39;t get to sign up for an exam section, what can I do to be able to take my exam\\xa0  Could I bring and use a highlighter on the exam packet tomorrow? Or will that mess up grading?   Thanks!  Is this false because the parent class constructor is not called unless we use the super keyword within the subclass constructor?  Do we have office hours today and tomorrow?          Question 18 says &#34;A class that is designed as a composition will generally have its components specified as parameters to its constructor&#34; is false. Can someone provide a little bit more explanation?       I understand that composition is when a class has another class object as a parameter (has-a) relationship. My questions are:      - &#34;a class that is designed as a composition&#34; which class is that referring to? For example if we have the classes Car and Engine, is the one that is &#34;designed as a composition&#34; Car or Engine? I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s Car but I just want to make sure   - why would it not have its components specified as parameters to the constructor? If I&#39;m making a new Car object, does it make sense to have a constructor that lets me do: Car newCar = new Car(v6Engine)?        Where do students get the practice exam from 2014? Is the problem from the recitation slide?  an iterator provides a way to access elements of an aggregate object sequentially by exposing its underlying representation\\xa0      The slides say this:      Online, it says that the observable needs to call setChanged(); before calling notifyObservers(); for any change to occur. However, on the Lecture 17 example 2, the setChanged() method is never called before\\xa0notifyObservers() in the scorePoints method. How does this work? Does setChanged() need to be called explicitly? \\xa0  Is it true that an observable can have multiple observers but an observer can only watch one observable? I feel like I heard it in lecture or in review sessions but can&#39;t find a solid answer anywhere.   Thanks!      This is from Lec 9 on slide 14 and I wanted to make sure my answers were correct but I&#39;m also not sure if/why you can write the code written in the blue circles.   m is a type Media taking the value of s which is a type Song but Media doesn&#39;t have eveything that song has so can you/why can you do this?   Thanks!  I am confused by &#34;d&#34; is not also an answer...   The sample FRQ shows using an abstract class AbstractSandwich. Originally I just made a base class SandwichImpl that was not abstract. I know using an abstract class is probably a better practice, but is it necessary?      Also, why are there methods marked &#64;Override in AbstractSandwhich when they are never overridden?        On the released 2018 exam the question asks :      For each given type declaration, mark A if the type is a valid value type, B if the type is a valid reference type, or C if the declaration is not a valid type.   30. Integer      the answer key says this is a reference type but in KMP&#39;s slides for JAVA programming basics, integers are specifically under primitive data types. Can someone explain?  Will the midterm cover up until the topic we do on this Thursday? For this writing code portion of the exam, namely the LibraryImpl class, and under the second addToLibrary method, should the code be new BookImpl( ... ) instead of just new Book( ... )? Where can I find the GitHub link for A5?  is our midterm going to be similar to the 2018 midterm in terms of difficulty? i find the 2018 one to be pretty tricky and difficult, so i am just wondering! thanks!  What are the hard deadlines for the assignments?  On the midterm review slides, under where it says whether or not there is a curve, it says to look at A1. Is that referring to our assignment? Cause\\xa0wasn&#39;t that about food shopping? If you left a pink pencil case at the review session, I have it!! I’ll leave it in the office hours room tomorrow!! I am trying to get a clearer idea of which final grade averages correspond to which letter grades. In other words, what final averages must someone achieve in order to get a B, a C, or a D in the class? The syllabus doesn&#39;t really touch on this, and it is my understanding that it is usually up to the instructor to decide. Can anyone here provide some insight? Is a plate’s contents being empty the same as it being null?\\xa0 hi,   can anyone explain the differences between class method and instance method?   thanks in advance!     Hey I got a problem with how to construct BeltImpl and how the belt class works. I have been stuck on this for many days. I wrote my code like this      public class BeltImpl implements Belt{ \\tprivate int belt_size; \\tprivate List&lt;Plate&gt; platesServed; \\t \\tpublic BeltImpl(int belt_size) { \\t\\tthis.belt_size = belt_size; \\t\\tthis.platesServed = new ArrayList&lt;Plate&gt;(belt_size); \\t\\t \\t\\tif(belt_size&lt;=0) { \\t\\t\\tthrow new IllegalArgumentException(&#34;the size of the belt can&#39;t be zero!&#34;); \\t\\t} \\t\\t \\t\\t \\t}   And i got Index out of 0 kinda message. Is it wrong that I use arraylist&lt;Plate&gt; platesServed in this class?  hey guys,   \\xa0I am reviewing the lecture slides for midterm and there is something about interface that I am quite confused with.   can anyone help to explain? thanks!      Are all the design patterns we&#39;ve learned so far gonna be on the exam?  Is this portion of JUnit test supposed to call from_0.next() twice in order to sync up with from_2?            We&#39;re gonna have one last review session for the midterm tomorrow (3/19) from 7 to 8 PM in Murphey 116.\\xa0 We will go over some of the design patterns you&#39;ll see on your test so try to make it if you can!  Does anyone know what this message means when I run my code on gradescope. Almost all the tests returned this message.      Index 2 out-of-bounds for length 0  How long will the midterm last? Will it last as long as one lecture (75 mins) or one recitation (50 mins)? Or will it last a different amount of time?      &#64;Test      public void testBeltIterator() throws BeltPlateException {      // I often use this loop to ensure there are no plates I forgot to clear      for (int i = 0; i &lt; correctBelt.getSize();i&#43;&#43;) {      correctBelt.clearPlateAtPosition(i);      }      correctBelt.setPlateAtPosition(plate1,1);      correctBelt.setPlateAtPosition(plate2,2);      correctBelt.setPlateAtPosition(plate3,3);      correctBelt.setPlateAtPosition(plate4,4);            emptyBelt.iterator();      emptyBelt.iteratorFromPosition(0);      emptyBelt.iteratorFromPosition(10);      emptyBelt.iteratorFromPosition(-10);      emptyBelt.iteratorFromPosition(100);            Iterator&lt;Plate&gt; from_default = correctBelt.iterator();      Iterator&lt;Plate&gt; from_0 = correctBelt.iteratorFromPosition(0);      Iterator&lt;Plate&gt; from_100 = correctBelt.iteratorFromPosition(100);      Iterator&lt;Plate&gt; from_10 = correctBelt.iteratorFromPosition(10);      Iterator&lt;Plate&gt; from_neg10 = correctBelt.iteratorFromPosition(-10);              for (int i=0; i&lt;4; i&#43;&#43;) {          assertEquals(from_0.next(), from_default.next());          }          for (int i=0; i&lt;4; i&#43;&#43;) {          assertEquals(from_0.next(), from_100.next());          }        for (int i=0; i&lt;4; i&#43;&#43;) {      assertEquals(from_10.next(), from_neg10.next());      }              Iterator&lt;Plate&gt; from_2 = correctBelt.iteratorFromPosition(2);        // from_0 iterator should be about to server plate1 from position 1      // calling next() should make it synched with from_2        from_0.next();                for (int i=0; i&lt;4; i&#43;&#43;) {          assertEquals(from_0.next(), from_2.next());          }        }       For the test in the last for loop, if the entire belt of from_0.next() rounds twice and from_0.next() is called only once after that, should the index not start from 1 not 2? Or am i missing something?  I have written some codes like &#34;RedPlate test1 = new RedPlate(null); \\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0BluePlate test3 = new BluePlate(null);&#34;   By using getProfit(), I got both 0,0, which I think is exactly what the requirement is, but I don&#39;t know why I get null on autograder.   Someone says I need to check for NullPointerException but I have no idea how to do that.  Do we have to worry about losing points for the code style if\\xa0 we leave in &#64;Override when we don&#39;t need it? What about the method stub?      I&#39;m a little confused about the correlation between BeltImpl, BeltFullException, and BeltIterator. From the answer from a previous question on Piazza, I understand that the BeltImpl class is supposed to make a belt that is an array. So how can the BeltIterator iterate through this array?\\xa0  can anyone explain to me why I would be getting null here, or what that means in context? thanks.      For every one of my IngredientPortion classes(ie. AvocadoPortion) tests, I am getting &#34;Test Failed. null&#34;. I have written my own code to try and see what the issue is, but I cannot figure it out. I also think this error is what is\\xa0causing failures in my adept and jedi portions of A4.         In comp 110 we were taught to name instance variables with an underscore: _example   However, the lecture slides considers this type of naming as &#34;legal but not considered good&#34;   The code style sheet does not say that starting with an underscore is wrong.      What is preferred and if I have already done _instanceVariable should I change the variables?      Thanks.  After reading the Belt interface and the readme over and over im still confused on how to the BeltImpl works. How are plates stored? Are we supposed to make an array in the constructor with the length of the belt size? The belt just is overall just confusing me.\\xa0 For example, for getPlateAtPosition, is it as simple as finding that index in an array of plates?\\xa0  I keep getting this on my A5 assignment for all my tests, although my code passes all the JUnit tests.         &#64;Override     public IngredientPortion[] getIngredients() {         return ingredient;     }      &#64;Override     public int getCalories() {          double cal = 0;          for (int i = 0; i &lt; ingredient.length; i&#43;&#43;) {              cal &#43;= ingredient[i].getCalories();          }          return ((int) (cal &#43; 0.5));     }      &#64;Override     public double getCost() {          double cos = 0;          for (int i = 0; i &lt; ingredient.length; i&#43;&#43;) {              cos &#43;= ingredient[i].getCost();          }         return ((int) ((cos * 100.0) &#43; 0.5)) / 100.0;     }     I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m doing the right thing for these 3 methods above but the autograder is telling me that I&#39;m wrong especially the getIngredients method which I have no idea why it&#39;s returning null.\\xa0         A4Adept Test 6 (0.0/0.25)     Output: Testing nigiri getCalories Test failed. expected:&lt;49&gt; but was:&lt;53&gt;         A4Adept Test 7 (0.0/0.25)     Output: Testing nigiri getCost Test failed. expected:&lt;1.32&gt; but was:&lt;2.09&gt;         A4Adept Test 8 (0.0/0.25)     Output: Testing nigiri getIngredients Test failed. null      Hi! I cannot figure out how to add Plate objects onto certain positions on the belt?  I&#39;m really confused about what it wants. My code seems right, yet it keeps insisting that I&#39;m wrong. Also, I read the comment about\\xa0how it measures through getCalories() but that is working fine for me.      Can someone tell me why it&#39;s behaving like this?  I&#39;ve been working on A4, and my code is mostly finished but there are a few problems when I submit it to Gradescope. I want to be able to fix these, but the problem is that Java won&#39;t let me create anything to test Adept or Jedi with, because everytime I try to create a test variable like this:      private IngredientPortion sushi = new SushiPortion(0.5);      I get the following error:      &#34;Default constructor cannot handle exception type Exception thrown by implicit super constructor. Must define an explicit constructor&#34;      I know that this is caused from the ShrimpPortion constructor throwing an Exception, but I can&#39;t remove that because it has to be there for the assignment. Is there a different way I can create a test object? Or is this an error that shouldn&#39;t happen, and I have to go back and fix my classes?      Thank you!  I did the import for A5 but it caused github issues because everytime I commited A5 it would update A4 online so I was wondering what&#39;s the most proper way to do this without caused github commit issues.      Does the null mean that my objects are not being initialized correctly? When I ran the JUnit test on my machine it highlighted Plate p = new RedPlate(null) and I&#39;m not too sure why it wouldn&#39;t initialize\\xa0at all given that null is something that should be able to initialize my object.  For getProfit(), it needs to be two decimal places, but not rounded. I can either get it to three or one, but rounded. Is there a specific way I should cut off decimals?\\xa0   For example, output should be .39, but I can either get .395 or .4    Is there a version of 2018 Fall practice exam without answers provided?    Hello,      I am trying to figure out how to go about fixing the issue of bananas being separated as shown below:      will missing today&#39;s recitation affect our participation grade?  Is everyone else getting the Sakai announcements sent to their email? I just checked today and realized there were a ton of announcements that I hadn&#39;t seen. For my other classes, Sakai sends me an email every time an announcement is posted but not for COMP. Does anyone know of a way to fix that on my end? Thanks!  I am very stuck on this part of the assignment...      It appears that\\xa0my setContents method in the PlateImpl class does not &#34;properly&#34; raise an exception for PlatePriceException. I tried running the A5Tests and it shows that the exception is not thrown.      I am including screenshots of the relevant code... hopefully someone would be able to provide insight on this issue.                       I am getting a very weird error in Gradescope. When I run the a5 tests, I get an error that says, &#34;Java.lang.AssertionError: Should have raised PlatePriceException.&#34;      My PlatePriceException class is in my package, where it should be. When I create plate objects my main class that should throw the PlatePriceException, they do throw the exception, as it should.      I have gone to office hours and still could not figure it out.  Fill out this anonymous Google form with any questions you want to go over in midterm review tomorrow! Also posted on Sakai.       https://goo.gl/forms/a9T3b61twyEbBScl2        Are we supposed to also provide the remove() methods to PriceThresholdBeltIterator and ColorFilteredBeltIterator?      \\xa0A class can extend any number of parent classes.    I have already passed all the JUnit tests on my own computer. But when I was pushing it to Gradescope an error occurred that says: * * *   tried to access method a5.BluePlate.&lt;init&gt;(La5/Sushi;)V from class a5test.A5Tests    * * * And this error *only* exists in the third test (i.e., this error only occurs for the BluePlate class and it occurs every time even though I&#39;ve checked several times this class was pushed successfully to Gradescope.)      For the remove() functions described in this assignment, should we *clear the position in the original belt* or should we *delete the element from this iterator* ?    I&#39;m struggling to figure out how to make good tests myself. It would be greatly appreciated!  Will the code copied from A4 be evaluated for style alongside the brief Plate code written in A5? Or will only the Plate code be evaluated?  how do we get to A6? i did not get an invite in my email  I&#39;m somewhat confused on the parameters used in PlateImpl. From the Plate interface I gather that we must use contents (but I don&#39;t know what its type is), and must somehow have the color and prize associations of Plate available to us when calling the methods. How can I do this? I passed all of my J unit tests on eclipse, but when I commit my changes and submit it on gradescope I receive an error that no class definition was found. I&#39;m working on A4 Jedi using Arraylist. However when I submit my code to Autograder, my A4 Adept went wrong and it says Java heap space. Does anyone know what that means? I am struggling to understand what exactly I did wrong in my code. The autograder just says that the test failed without saying what method. I suspect it is the get cost method but I don’t see how it wouldn’t just be: amount* &lt;ingredientType&gt;.getPricePerOunce()     I attached a picture of the failed tests for reference.\\xa0   Is this Friday&#39;s recitation optional and if so what will be covered in the recitation?\\xa0  I&#39;m just a little confused about the instructions for A6. The readme says &#34;normalized_position = ((position % size) &#43; size) % size&#34; as the formula for converting the size passed to the constructor into the corresponding position. But where do we get the position value that is included in the mod with size (since the only thing we&#39;re giving the constructor is size)? I&#39;ve read over the comments in the Belt\\xa0interface too but\\xa0I&#39;m still confused.\\xa0  Are the A5 test cases posted somewhere?  What is the difference between the &#34;value of price given to the constructor&#34;,\\xa0 &#34;cost of contents&#34;, and &#34;plate price&#34;? Since this plate price is variable, I&#39;m confused about how we set a price and where that number is coming from.\\xa0    Can we use different packages to contain classes in our Assignment 4, 5, and 6? It&#39;s \\xa0**really messy** for us to find the according classes that we want from a long list of classes and interfaces.  * * * (i.e., could we group all *ingredients* to one package, and group all *ingredientPortions* into one package? )    Gradescope said that my test failed for getContents when it returned null, but it was supposed to return null. I&#39;ve already tested all my code and it has worked, so I don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong.   This is what the grader says:   Output: Testing GreenPlate GreenPlate created with contents null getColor returns GREEN getPrice returns 2.0 getContents ran and returns null Test failed. null      I don&#39;t think the grader is just running a different method after getContents because I have a print statement that runs when a method runs and nothing pops up after getContents.     For each specific plate, we have;   &#34;A null value for contents indicates that the plate should be initially empty.&#34;   Does this mean we should still set the price and color while setting the contents null, or should we just throw an exception?  I can&#39;t push my A5 onto git to my A5starter repository... should I just make my own repository and copy and paste?? help  I&#39;ve tested my code\\xa0for redPlate in my program and the getColor method is returning red as the color like it should. Except when I submit to gradescope it&#39;s saying: expected: &lt;RED&gt; but was &lt;null&gt;. Does anyone know why this might be happening?\\xa0    I am a bit confused on how to pass the Sashimi and Nigiri getIngredient and pass the test.  I submitted my A4 code and it&#39;s passing all tests except for Novice 18 and 19, which I&#39;ve copied here. Strangely, when I\\xa0tested the provided JUnit tests in Eclipse, all the tests pass, but for some reason it&#39;s not working in the autograder. I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;m doing wrong?   https://github.com/nkomirisetti/RecitationCodeStyle.git   In recitation today someone asked: if you have a method that takes 10 parameters and it goes off screen, is it better to do one parameter per line and have 10 lines or is it better to split it into like a line of 5 and another line of 5?      The answer is to split into 5 and 5, or some other combination of a few parameters per line (i.e. 3,3,4). Otherwise, it would get too long to have 10 lines of 1 parameter each. Hope this helped!  does anyone know the code for my digital hand? I can&#39;t seem to find it anywhere   https://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2019/03/computer-science-misogyny-column-0228?fbclid=IwAR1cGWTFh8OrNJr1Z60E5pRnrlKk9rmna0MGn-o8l-Lny3BF08RJIjQ2xgA   I made an abstract class, PlateImpl, to hold all the methods that each individual type of plate must be able to execute. My JUnit test keeps coming up with message &#34;default constructor cannot handle exception type &#34;PlatePriceException&#34; thrown by implicit super constructor. Must define an implicit constructor.&#34; whenever I try to initialize a new plate, even though I specified in all of my subclass constructors that they also could throw a PlatePriceException. Any help?    public class AvocadoPortion extends IngredientPortionImpl{  \\tstatic Avocado avocado = new Avocado(); \\tpublic AvocadoPortion(double amount) { \\t\\tsuper(avocado, amount); \\t}  }   My code for AvocadoPortion looks like this, however when I submitted it to gradescope, I got that the Ingredient value was null. The message that popped up was from what I coded in IngredientPortionImpl for when ingredient was null. Is the above wrong, or is my test for if ingredient is null just wrong. For the PlateImpl class in A5, I am a little confused about what our parameters should be in the constructor. Right now I have a price and color, but what is the parameter representing the contents of the plate--is it IngredientPortion[ ] or Sushi[ ] or something else? Also the getContents() method returns Sushi, or null if the plate is empty. What if a plate just has a RicePortion, which won&#39;t return a Sushi object or return null for getContents()? I&#39;m attempting to use an array list to complete A4 Jedi. When I run the following code, I get this error: &#34;Type mismatch: cannot convert from Object[] to IngredientPortion[]&#34;. How do I fix this?      List&lt;IngredientPortion&gt; ingredients = new ArrayList&lt;IngredientPortion&gt;();   IngredientPortion[] ingrArr = ingredients.toArray();  It says my IngredientPortion classes are &#34;null&#34; and my Junit tests are red for this part. I had the same error for ingredients and was able to fix it, but I cannot think of what would be wrong for this one.\\xa0  Whenever I click the invitation link for A4 I get the &#34;ready to go&#34; page, but the repository isn&#39;t being created and the link brings me to a nonexistent page. The repository isn&#39;t showing up in settings for me to delete and try again either. Does anyone know how to fix this? Thanks!       Why is   Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in) while(s.hasNext()){ ..... }   assessed as true by the while&#39;s test statement even if we have not typed anything in yet?  I am working on A4 adept and every time I submit it to gradescope I get &#34;null&#34; error messages on all the adept tests, even on methods that don&#39;t return objects. I am very confused am I am not sure where to begin to look in my code to fix this. My novice classes pass all their tests. Help!  I tried accepting Assignment 5, but it would not load after a couple of hours, so I left the repository in my settings. When I clicked the link on Sakai again, I didn&#39;t get the option to accept the assignment again, it went straight to the setup page for the repository. It&#39;s been stuck loading there for a very long time now, but the repository hasn&#39;t shown up in my Repositories area under Settings, nor does it show up in the class. It&#39;s also been importing the starter code for almost a day now. Is there anything else I can do to get this going in the right direction?  I&#39;m working on Jedi and I&#39;m really confused about the combine ingredients part of it. I&#39;ve tried to set it up in the constructor but I can&#39;t figure out how to get it to combine the ingredients in the input array and remove the duplicates at the same time  In A4 for Roll and Sashimi classes I had to implement my getCalories methods in different ways in order for the autograder to not be off by a value of one.\\xa0      In Roll of A4 I had to sum the amounts as doubles and then cast to int at the end in order to pass the autograder tests, in the exact same way that I implemented MenuItemImpl&#39;s getCalories method in A3.      In Sashimi/Nigiri of A4 I casted the doubles to integers\\xa0while summing in order to get the correct value instead of rounding and casting at the end.      Is this intentional? Seeing that these classes are going to be used going forward I would like to make sure this won&#39;t cause issues in the future.  I was just confused on\\xa0the AvocadoPortion class, on how to use an instance of the Avocado class\\xa0as the Ingredient as well as where the combine method would be used. Thanks.  I tried to leave a1 and re-access to the repository. But when I try to access to a1 again 404 error appears and I could not get access to a1 again.    When I want to import my A5, it just keeps importing starter code for hours. I cannot figure out what&#96;s wrong with the repository.  My code in A4 jedi, according to all of my JUnit Test Cases, adds Seaweed correctly.\\xa0 However, the autograder does not accept this.\\xa0 Therefore, I was trying to submit a regrade request, but when I click on A4 Test 2 it is not an option.\\xa0 Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Are we supposed to be using inheritance in adept too? I know the read me didn&#39;t say anything about it and I&#39;ve gotten some of the methods in the sashimi class to work without it. I&#39;m just confused about how we would use it if we do need to because when I make the constructor with &#34;public Sashimi(SashimiType type)...&#34; it tells me that I need to declare the super constructor first, but those parameters are (name, IngredientPortion[]) not SashimiType.  A lot of my autograder\\xa0tests fail with the line\\xa0      tried to access method a4.Avocado.&lt;init&gt;()V from class a4test.A4NoviceTest   I tried to search online, and I only found something about missing a default constructor.   Here is my constructor for the Avocado class:    private Avocado() { \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0super(&#34;avocado&#34;, 42, .24, true, false, false); }     When I changed the constructor to public, the autograder tests passed, but then it doesn&#39;t follow singleton design which\\xa0I want to attempt.  Im a bit confused on how to encapsulate fields and then access them in subclasses and set their value based off the ingredient since there are no setter methods in the interface.\\xa0  I&#39;m working on the Sashimi class and I can get the &#34;get name&#34; method to work, but how do I get the program to connect the type of sashimi to the ingredient it corresponds to? Like I need it to know the cost, calories, etc. of the SashimiType based on the amount (0.75), but I can&#39;t figure out how to set that up with the enum.\\xa0  I am trying to get the code from GitHub to start the assignment. However, it has been importing for more than 45 minutes. I have exited out and tried it again, and this time it is on minute 30. I know it says it may take a while, but am I doing something wrong? This is what it looks like...    Screen_Shot_20190222_at_12.37.47_PM.png       I am just confused on the instructions here for A4 Novice. So for each ingredient class (i.e Avocado), would each one implement Ingredient Interface? So, we wouldn&#39;t make a IngredientImpl class which Avocado could extend because it says for the Avocado constructor to have no parameters? If this is the case then where would inheritance be used.      Thanks.  Who should I contact about missing recitation due to illness? I have a doctor&#39;s excuse and wanted to provide the TAs with it in order to excuse a recitation absence.      Thanks!  Can anyone explain what is a static method? Also when and why do I use a static method?  What does those number &lt;104&gt; or &lt;103&gt; represent?   I&#39;m working on A4 Novice and I&#39;m having trouble understanding inheritance and how to set up the constructors. I know in the &#34;AvocadoPortion&#34; class I just need the &#34;amount&#34; parameter, but does that mean my superclass constructor parameters should match that? That confused me because I feel like the program has to have a way to differentiate between types of ingredient portions, I just don&#39;t know how to set it up.\\xa0  I am curious about the format of exam 1 so I can begin studying. Will it be more geared towards concepts from lecture or writing actual code? If it is based on concepts, will it be free-response, true/false, multiple choice... Just wondering! Thanks:)  Can anyone explain what is a default method, and when and why do I use a default method?  How does the input for A3 adept look? I&#39;m trying to visualize what&#39;s going into the ingredients array. I finished writing the assignments I just need the access code for gradescope I accidentally deleted my dummy file on GitHub before uploading all my other files, so to fix this I had to recreate new\\xa0src and a3 folders to put all my code in it, but I think it might have messed up my structure. The auto-grader is treating it as there&#39;s a compilation error but there aren&#39;t any (at least not in Novice) and when I test my code on a local server it works.\\xa0   I&#39;m having issues with the autograder for Assignment 4. For every part of the assignment that isn&#39;t involving the getName() methods, it just tells me my test failed and says &#34;null.&#34;\\xa0Does anybody have an idea on what&#39;s going wrong here?  I still haven&#39;t received an email from my cohort... what should I do?  Somehow, I have the numbers right for the amount, because as you add them up and they end up correct. However, I cannot figure out how to add the two banana values together into one. Can I get some help?   I just submitted my A2 Adept and every single value matches but it&#39;s saying it is wrong.\\xa0 The only thing I can think that would cause this error is that the spacing is off because mine all line up and I didn&#39;t add the indent because I don&#39;t know how.\\xa0 How would I do that?\\xa0 I even resubmitted it with a couple spaces added to make it match the spacing but it still didn&#39;t work.  I submitted A3 Novice &amp; Adept without Jedi and got full points on that. After I submitted Jedi without making any changes to the other parts, I got the point for Jedi, but I didn&#39;t get any points for Novice or Adept.      This shows at the bottom of each failed test:      a3.IngredientImpl.&lt;init&gt;(Ljava/lang/String;DIZ)V   How do I fix this? Thanks!  I want to print out my Ingredient arrays in A3 but the outcomes are codes like &#34;[La3.IngredientImpl;&#64;2d209079&#34;. Does that mean that there is something wrong or anything I can do to change it into array format?\\xa0  A4 Adept requires us to define public enumerations, which I don&#39;t think we have learned in class yet. The soft deadline for the assignment is this Sunday though, so are there any resources we can look at about enumeration, or should we wait till next Tues/Thurs to finish A4 (will we be learning enumeration next week)?  I am not sure why this test fails for my code. My constructor is set up with an if statement to check if the ingredient is null and if it is returns an exception.\\xa0Are there any tips for this test?      edit: I solved the problem, I used throw new Exception(), rather than throw new RuntimeException().  How do I round cost to two decimal places for the getCost method in MenuItemImp?  Can we extend a non-abstract class?   If so, how?  My code failed 3 of the four tests because my calories are off by one. Originally, I thought this was because I didn&#39;t use his hint of casting an int and adding .5, but I did that and resubmitted with no change. Any idea why this is happening?  Are we supposed to use setters for a3 even though those methods aren&#39;t specified in the assignment? The autograder says it can&#39;t access my ingredient interface for Novice, but I got credit for jedi and parts of adept so I&#39;m not sure what could be incorrect.       My outputs for A2 adept test 4 and jedi test 3 match the expected output\\xa0but the autograder is still counting them wrong. I was wondering how to fix this.         My answer is exactly the same as the autograder except this space at the end of my output. I have this space on all my outputs but only Jedi 3 has an issue. If this is the actual issue, how would I fix it?      Thanks.  What topics should we be reviewing to prepare for assignment 4?  At the very end of the Adept3, it says\\xa0    Be sure to clone the array of ingredient portions passed to the constructor so that you encapsulate a copy of the array rather than the original array. If you don&#39;t, then you can&#39;t prevent the elements from being changed by whatever code provided the array to the constructor.  Similarly, don&#39;t return your encapsulated ingredient portion array directly as the result of\\xa0 getIngredients \\xa0for the same reason. Be sure to return a clone.    But, I do not see how the elements of either array of Ingredient Portion or the String can be changed if it is being called in the class that has static main since every field is declared with private access modifier in every class. Even if, for some reasons, the array of Ingredient Portion is changed in IngredientPortionImpl, does MenuItemImpl not have to reflect this change?      I would appreciate it if someone could provide me with a line(s) of code that the instruction says would cause a problem or change the elements.  For the method combine(IngredientPortion other), does anyone know what should be returned if other is null? I tried to return IngredientPortion but it says it can&#39;t be resolved to a variable.  I submitted my code for Novice and it passed tests 2 &amp; 3 but not test 1. It said the ingredient instance it tested used &#34;spinach&#34; for the name but when my code ran it threw the run time exception for when the name string is null. I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s doing this because after I have my if clauses to test for null or negative inputs, I have it set each part ex: this.name = name;\\xa0\\xa0  With cohorts starting up please be in the lookout for an email from your cohort leaders. It&#39;s important that you respond to these emails so that everything can get up and running!\\xa0  Does anyone have the Thinking In Java textbook resource that was posted on the syllabus? The link on the current syllabus document doesn&#39;t work.      thanks.  When I try to switch my branch, I get the screen below. I do not see this when I switch my branch in other projects. Does anyone know what is causing this to show up?   Does anyone know when the auto grader for A3 will be released?  When writing the class &#34;IngredientImpl&#34;, the constructor uses the variable &#34;price&#34;, however the interface &#34;Ingredient&#34; uses the getters named &#34;getPricePerOunce&#34;. The constructor does not say to include ounces which seems like it causes a problem. This is also a problem with the class constructor using the variable &#34;calories&#34; and the interface using the methods &#34;getCaloriesPerOunce&#34; and also\\xa0&#34;getCaloriesPerDollar&#34;. What would be the best way to address this problem?    I&#39;m trying to declare a double array and I&#39;m getting a NullPointerException for that line. I&#39;ve tried moving for loop structure, brackets etc around but I&#39;m still getting the same message?\\xa0  Hello everyone,      I know many of you are experiencing issues regarding using the debugger.\\xa0   Please come to office hours so we can help you fix any specific problems you may be having. Learning the debugger is essential to this course and we are happy to help you get oriented with using the debugger efficiently.\\xa0      Also, I would highly recommend the following video to get started on using it:      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xuo4vwm0SA8  I know there are others posting their questions about fail to build because of &#34;didn&#39;t find a ant file to run&#34; or something but I didn&#39;t get any clue how to solve this problem still. I can run A1 and A2 but failed to run lec and rec files. Does anyone know how to solve it?  Hi guys!      I just submitted my A1 and A2 on the gradescope autograder but it appeared 0.0/10.0 on both. However when I used the input on autograder with my program, the outputs are all correct as well as the format. What should I do? How can we contact our recitation instructors ? And how do we know who our instructor is ? it isn’t on sakai or connect carolina   What&#39;s the difference between them? Why in the same class there are both class and instance method?   Hi all,   like the title says, after I pushed my A1 to git to attempt to grade it, i got 0/10 despite the code working perfectly fine in eclipse. After i looked at my code on gradescope it was the blank starter class that says //Write your code here. Any one have a similar problem?     \\tpublic static int GetMin(double totalprices[]) { \\t\\t   int b = 0; \\t\\t   double c = 0; \\t\\t\\tfor (int i = 0; i &lt; totalprices.length; i&#43;&#43;) { \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tif (c &gt; totalprices[i]) { \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tb = i; \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tc = totalprices[i]; \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t} \\t\\t\\t} \\t\\t\\treturn b; \\t\\t\\t \\t\\t}   I attempted to write a method that would return the cell of the minimum value of the array, however it always ends up returning index 0 instead of the index of the cell with the actual minimum value. What am I doing wrong?    How do I join the 401 class for Gradescope? I feel like I&#39;ve looked everywhere, but I can&#39;t find the class code.    public static int search(String nameofindividualitem, String itemnames[]) { \\t\\tint a = 0; \\t\\tfor (int i = 0; i &lt; itemnames.length; i&#43;&#43;) { \\t\\t\\tif (itemnames[i].equals(nameofindividualitem)) { \\t\\t\\t\\ti=a; \\t\\t\\t} \\t\\t} \\t\\t\\t \\t\\treturn a; \\t}   I&#39;m currently trying to get this method to return the integer value of the cell of the array itemnames when the local variable nameofindividualitem equals the cell in itemnames. When trying to run the program, it ends up hanging whenever it reaches this step, what can I change to make it work properly?  Hey   Any advice on how to tackle Jedi?   I am trying to figure out how to store the rolls ingredients and ounces and how to access them when it come up in the order. Some of the TAs did\\xa0recommend\\xa0a double array, but I can&#39;t figure out how to set up the second array.     Any hints on how to effectively store the names and contents of the recipes?      Without using classes I was confused about how to associate the ingredients with the recipe names, and with a recipe class I am confused about how to name each class before recording the ingredients in a &#34;for&#34; loop.  When creating a new class, it always asks me to choose which methods I would like to create.   1. public static void main(Str[] args)   2. Constructors from superclass   3. Inherited abstract methods.   I know what method the 1st one is, but what about 2 and 3?  Whenever I import a cloned project from git to package explorer, it doesn&#39;t run on its own and the error message comes up :\\xa0   Every time I try to import the assignment file to my Package Explorer, I get stopped at the Import Projects step with an error message that says &#34;No Projects Found.&#34; Any tips? I watched the video on the COMP 401 YouTube channel, but it looks like as soon as he clicks on import projects after right-clicking the repository, he&#39;s able to click finish immediately whereas I have to go through a series of steps.\\xa0      Here&#39;s a picture attached of where I get stopped for reference. Thank you so much!   When code style is evaluated at the end of the semester will it be evaluated from gradescope or the git repos?      For this first linear assignment(A1 as well as potentially A2) is it appropriate to have a single comment block explaining what the program does? I don&#39;t have any methods written to write comments for and it seems like over commenting to have anything more than a block at the beginning for each.  For A2 adept, on the expected output, there is a slight space right before each of the different properties of the menu items (calorie count, price, vegetarian or not). Is that space a certain number of spaces or is it a tab?  How many days of lecture are we allowed to miss, if any, before it starts to affect our attendance grade?  Does anyone not have the lecture 03 repository path shown up on the Repository Links website? I cannot see one, and I was wondering if it has to do with the fact that I was absent on that day. For assignment A1, I created a couple of helper classes in separate files and committed them to GitHub alongside the rest of the code.    However, when I put it the code through the autograder, it stated that the classes were undefined and didn&#39;t give me credit for code even though it was working completely fine in Eclipse. I even tried importing them in the code with the import command but that did not help either.\\xa0     I ended up just copying and pasting the class definitions into each file they were used in and that worked, but I feel like there has to be a better way to get it to work with the autograder.\\xa0  \\xa0    I posted a video on the COMP 401 youtube channel demonstrating how to use the eclipse debugger. I believe this topic will be covered in this week&#39;s recitation but if you are curious about the debugger already then check it out! The code that I work with in this video can be found here:  https://github.com/aclarkbloop/SundaeBuilderDebug . Play around with this code and follow along with the video, then try using the debugger on your assignment code! Or, if you’re only interested in a basic tutorial, watch from the beginning up to around 4 minutes in. Feel free to ask me any other questions you may have about the debugger or debugging strategies in general!      Thanks guys!  If we want to use a helper function that we wrote in a past assignment/part of an assignment, are we allowed to use the same code again?  are we allowed to use\\xa0scan.nextBoolean(); in any of the A2 parts.\\xa0   There is no mention of it in the instructions. Thanks.\\xa0  I have finished A1 without committing every steps. Now I want to commit it but the git shows no unstaged changes so that I cannot commit. Is there any way to solve this problem?  I will be out of town this Friday so I won&#39;t be able to attend my normal recitation, but I remember KMP saying that it doesn&#39;t matter which recitation you attend. Where are the recitation schedules and is there anything I need to do if I attend a different recitation for that week?  Do we have to make our code pretty for the assignments if they are just auto graded?     Are office hours just walk in, or are they like Comp110 where we make an online appointment first?      Thanks :)  The output looks like it matches the expected output but for some reason the autograder thinks they&#39;re different.\\xa0Is anyone else running into this issue/ know of a potential solution?      Where is the office hour calendar located?  I want to make an array that can change sizes but in Java they must be declared a certain size. I know a way around this is with an array list but i have to import\\xa0util.ArrayList and util.List. Is this okay or should i find a new way around this? thanks.\\xa0  Whenever I try to run any of my files for a1 it says that it is unable to find the ant file to run. Any ideas on how to fix it? I have tried deleting and re-downloading the git files and it does not seem to work, but it worked the other day.  What are possible reasons the code from eclipse doesn&#39;t successfully commit and push to git?         I did what was in the video and pushed the new branches, but it keeps submitting empty codes.\\xa0      when running the code I wrote for a1 novice, it constantly shows input mismatch error.   does anyone know what should I do to solve it?   thanks in advance!     I was just wondering if we are only limited\\xa0to one submission when submitting to gradescope\\xa0or if we get multiple attempts. Thanks!

Does anyone know why this might be or if I set something up incorrectly?      EDIT: I got it to work right after I posted this. Have a good day y&#39;all.  How should we make sure to account for an item showing up for than once for a customer?  In the Hint section, it says we should use   String.format(&#34;%2f, value);   to make the value to 2 decimal places, but since it did not work, I imported   java.text.Decimalformat;   and created the numbers up to two decimal places.   When I do that, the number rounds if the subsequent number is equal to or greater than 5.\\xa0   Should I keep it this way or not round the number?  When it says print output to two decimal places, does that mean if the total says $2.20, our output should read 2.20.\\xa0Or is it okay if our output reads 2.2\\xa0  Hey everyone!      In recitation today, I asked about how to fetch stuff off GitHub into Eclipse.\\xa0I think\\xa0the &#34;In detail...&#34; part of this person&#39;s explanation on Stack Overflow walks through it pretty well.       https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19474186/egit-rejected-non-fast-forward       If you pushed something onto GitHub from a branch and then merged it to your master branch during the practice in recitation, you might get something that says &#34;rejected non fast forward&#34; that prevents your code from actually updating on GitHub. This should fix that too!  If anyone is having trouble with the eclipse.exe installer file, try downloading eclipse manually from this link. This fixed my issue.       https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/         For A1Jedi/A1Adept, should we consider the case where the the inputs are overlapped or inappropriate and affect the output?   For example,    3 Apple 0.25 Banana 0.75 Banana 0.15 2 Carrie Brownstein 2 2 Banana 1 Banana Corin Tucker 1 3 Apple    Or, do we just consider the inputs are completely appropriate (unique)??           For A1 Novice, how would functions like int(), nextInt(), and nextDouble() be able to sort through the names of the customers if they are looking at integers? And for a method that could look at the names, how would it be able to differentiate between the names of customers and the names of items purchased?  Will there be office Hours on Monday since it is a holiday?  Is there or is there going to be JUnit Test for assignment 1?  If there is more than one person who spends the largest or smallest amount of money (money spent is equal), then what should we do?  Does anyone know if it&#39;s feasible for the semester to puesdo-link up other programming\\xa0environments to Eclipse? I&#39;ve grown quite attached to VSCode from my time in prior CS courses and while I think I&#39;ve got it working in tandem with Eclipse to work on assignments, is it worth it?\\xa0  I notice that we are only allowed to use next(), nextInt(), etc for the assignment. Can we import and use ArrayList?   Thanks!  Everytime I try to download Eclipse it tells me I need to have network access or configure the proxy network.

When will assignment 1 be posted? Will it be posted to sakai or Piazza?  In the first lecture KMP mentioned that we should be running Java 11 with Eclipse but I along with others seem to have run into issues getting Eclipse to run Java 11 JDK (SDK). In recitation it appeared that many others were having the same issue and the LAs were similarly confused. After installing the Java 11 JDK and running the Eclipse installer you are prompted with this website, encouraging you to download either Java 8 or 7 JDK.   \\xa0    I have managed to download JDK 8 and switch the compiler to be compatible with 11 but in the configuration tab it states that Eclipse is running JRE 8 (not JDK 8 or JDK 11). Is having the compiler connected to the JDK 11 folder sufficient or is there more that has to be done to meet the requirements?\\xa0      If anyone has any ideas or has found some answers please share.

We love feedback!\", ' A9 and other grading will complete after Sat night but hopefully\\xa0at least one day before the exam         #pin  Class,      I believe certain aspects of ITS/Sakai have changed that are causing problems\\xa0not only when you upload assignments\\xa0but also when we download your uploaded assignments and upload back the feedback. The main problem is PPTX files - Sakai/ITS thinks some or all of them are problematic and either says so or gives some other error message. Your A6 assignments were ready for uploading during the weekend, but we were not able to upload them until yesterday\\xa0 because Sakai rejected the upload. After deleting all PPTX files, we were able to upload.\\xa0This is surprising even though you successfully uploaded these files and we\\xa0successfully downloaded them. A PPTX file was also the reason why one of the students could not upload his assignment.      So something has changed I believe and I have told Sakai folks about it - not confident they can or will fix it, and it may be an ITS problem. So for now do not upload PPTX files.      The other problem has to do with multiple sessions, Here is some text on this in a communication with one of the students:       Marla suggested that he log into Sakai via the link,\\xa0 sakai.unc.edu   , and log in with his  onyen  there instead of a bookmark or session that previously  expired,  and that  he  log out of his other sessions.\\xa0 It sounded like\\xa0he was on more than one computer logged into Sakai, and we did see that in his digital footprint.\\xa0 I would like to reiterate that having multiple active sessions in Sakai is disruptive and more so when on different computers.\\xa0 The reason he saw the ambiguous and misleading error message was in part a result of multiple sessions and on different servers with the same IP address/username .

Instruction to do that are here:  https://help.unc.edu/help/vpn-installation-and-clients/       #pin  Class,      This is the protocol to follow, see the Tracer.showInfo() call below, which I just added:      LAs:      Please do not defer to Andrew or me, try and understand the problem by coming to one of us:      Stop the program and re-run LocalChecks.   Do not execute Test All   Uncollapse all test suites.   Double click on one of the failed tests.   Look at the message in the explorer window for that test.   If the message does not make sense, call Tracer.showInfo(), illustrated below, to trace what the test case is doing:   package main;   import util.trace.Tracer;   import gradingTools.comp401f17.assignment4.testcases.Assignment1Suite;   public class RunTests1 {   \\xa0   public static void main(String[] args) {   Tracer.showInfo(true); // comment this out if you do not want test case output, which can get humongous   Assignment1Suite.main(args);// this is your test suite, it could be any suite   }   }   \\xa0   Look at the console output produced by this tracing   \\xa0   If you do not understand the messages quickly, post the output to Piazza.   Contact an instructor if asked or you do not get an answer soon.   If you submit the assignment with the error, there are two cases:   \\xa0\\xa0a) the test was wrong, so you get the credit.   \\xa0\\xa0b) your program was wrong, in which case you do not get credit.   Repeat this process of rerunning the program and double clicking for each failed test case.   \\xa0   If you do this just before a deadline, there is a good chance you will not get a reply in time.   \\xa0   Sometimes you cannot see all of the console output created by localchecks. This is because Eclipse clips the window contents by default. To override this, uncheck Preferences--&gt;Run/Debug--&gt;Console--&gt;Limit console output. On Windows, Preferences is a sub menu of Windows. On Macs, I think it is a submenu of Eclipse or File.   \\xa0   #pin  Here are the diary assignments. Please put your posts in the &#34;diary&#34; folder and the one for your grader so we can find them. This is assigned based your last name on Sakai.         Grader  Students    Ken  Alvord–Cragin    Jacob  Dai–Grimm    Jed  Guariglia–Lee    Andrew  Li–Peterson    Neeley  Powell–Talton    Sarah  Tedford–Zefri         #pin  Students:      A ton of diaries have been submitted today, most of which do not follow the correct format. You may not receive a personal note pointing out the mistake. Remember an automatic system will process these, so you have to follow it literally to get any credit.      Here\\xa0is an example, reproduced from the longer doc:\\xa0    PowerPoint     PDF    ------------------------------------example---------------------   jdoe, Jane Doe, Diary   9/7:   My Q&amp;A:   Instructor: What is the meaning of life?   My Answer: 42      Class Q&amp;A:   Instructor: What is the meaning of life?   Correct Answer: 42   Instructor:\\xa0What is your quest?   Correct Answer: Holy Grail      9/9:   My Q&amp;A:   None      Class Q&amp;A:   Instructor: What Is the Airspeed Velocity of an Unladen Swallow?   Correct Answer: 11 meters per second   ----------------------   For instructors:      When manually grading the diaries, you will create a series of entries, each in a separate followup, with each follow up representing a grading session, which can cover multiple lecture dates. The format of each follow up will look as follows:      -----------------------------------   Date: 9/10   My Q&amp;A:\\xa0 1*5 = &#43;5   Class Q&amp;A: 3*5 = &#43;15   Notes   Keep up the good work of answering questions.   ------------------------------------------   Here the instructor graded the two diaries above on 9/10 and created a follow up\\xa0that enters how many correct entries of My Q&amp;A and Class Q&amp;A were reported and assigns 5 points to each entry to compute the total points, 5 and 15.      The next follow up will be created the next time the instructor\\xa0grades the diaries and will grade diary entries for dates after the date of the previous follow up. So it\\xa0will ignore possibly new diary entries for dates before the date of the previous followup.   #pin        TAs,\\xa0LAs, and Class,      This note is addressed\\xa0to the TAs and LAs, but it also has implications for the students. So all, please read it carefully, and comment on it if something does not make sense. It is designed to maximize learning. Some of you may have been annoyed at my not answering your questions immediately - this document tries to give the rationale.         LAs\\xa0and TAs:       Face to Face Help:       1 . Distribute help : Do not spend all of your time, in class or in office hours, on a small number of students. The idea is not to make sure all of your assigned time is used for some help - the idea is to provide help to the maximum number of students. This means your must triage.   2.  Be aware of others while helping : In class, when helping a student, keep an eye out for how many others need help, and shorten or interrupt a longish session (&gt; 5 minutes) to see if someone else can be helped quicker.   3.  Learn what you do not know : If you cannot help a student, it is ok to bring me in, but do not send the students directly to me without accompanying them.\\xa0 Either pose the question to me or stay involved in the help session so that you learn the solution.   4.  Process  common  mistakes section : Before coming to me, look at the common mistakes section in the assignment, and see if the solution exists there. Also each time you help with a new kind of mistake, add to the section.   5.  Reduce problem:  If students are having trouble getting their programs to work correctly,\\xa0ask them to solve a smaller problem, and come back to them if they cannot solve it, and maybe reduce the problem even more.   6.  Tell them what to debug and how:  One way to do the above is to tell them to put a breakpoint or a print statement tracing the value of a variable as the program runs. So for example, if a value summed in a loop is not correct, do not just tell them that the value has not been initialized - tell them to print the value in the loop\\xa0 and they will themselves realize their mistake, probably.   7.\\xa0 No pre-submission grading : If a student asks you to tell them if their program looks right, do not answer the question. Even I do not remember the details of the requirements, and it is likely you will make a mistake.\\xa0Ask them if they have a\\xa0problem understanding a specific requirement, and if they do, bring up the text of the requirement and try and resolve the confusion, if it exists. You are not supposed to grade the assignment before it is officially submitted.   8.  Separate the what and\\xa0why of requirements : Some students will want to know why a requirement exists. Ask them to first implement the requirement before answering the why. Once they implement the requirement, it is likely they will understand the why on their own. For example, \\xa0knowing what indexOf() does and how it is used in assignment 1 are two separate issues and challenges.   9.  Look at hints:  Each assignment has a hints section, which explains how the problem is to be solved. Many of the why questions are answered there.   10.  Provide little or no help for extra credit:\\xa0 This is optional material and students who attempt extra credit should be able to do it with\\xa0minimal help. As LAs, you yourself may not have attempted it. So feel free to give little or no help for extra credit.   11.  Walk up and down the classroom aisles to solicit help : Several students are too shy to ask for help, and will ask for help only if they see you walking past their seats. So walk up and down the aisles to solicit help.         .....       Help on Piazza:       1. Make sure you read everything on Piazza and also you should answer questions if you are sure of the answer.   2. However, do not answer a question immediately, if you think some other student can answer it. Wait at least half a day.               &lt;This note will be edited as we better understand the helping process and the problems that arise&gt;      #pin        Basic tutorials on getting started with Java from Oracle:     https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/     \\xa0   For those of you who took 116, here is a transition to Java for Python Programmers:     http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/java4python/index.html    #pin  Do not send email for a special appointment unless you cannot make any of these office hours.    \\xa0   \\xa0   Regular Schedule, Dewan:   Office: FB 150   Email: help401-002-f18&#64;cs.unc.edu   Office Hours:\\xa0Tuesday 12:15 to 13:30, Thu 15:30 to 16:30   \\xa0   Regular schedule (Tas and LAs), room: FB 008   \\xa0   Mondays:    Sarah - 2:25-3:25 (she will probably not be in on 9/10)  Jed - 1:00-2:00  Neeley - 11:15-1:15  Jacob -\\xa05:00-6:30    \\xa0   Tuesdays:    Ken - 3:30-5:30    \\xa0   Wednesdays:    Sarah - 2:25-3:25  Neeley - 11:15-1:15    \\xa0   Thursdays:    Ken - 3:30-5:30  Jacob - 2:00-5:30  Neeley - 12:30 - 1:30    \\xa0   Fridays:    Jed - 2:20-5:20  Chris - 4:00-6:00, Davis\\xa05051    \\xa0   \\xa0   #pin       A class can extend any number of parent classes.     Class,      Sakai should show you your final grades. Enclosed are the cutoffs I used - I ensured there was a &gt; 1 % gap between the\\xa0grades adjacent to the boundaries. I did not end up using the what I have learned part of the diary as I was going to give it a 0.25% weight and the gaps were such that it would not have made a difference. Andrew and I looked at the complete performance of students at the boundaries, including what you got right and wrong in the exams and the last assignment you completed , before we committed\\xa0to them.         If Sakai does not show the same grade as the one you get, let me know.      I enjoyed teaching the class and interacting with you, and hope to be in touch with you in the future. Feel free to come by for any advice I can give.      The conclusions section on the course page has the recording of the last day of class - again look at the video before any internship interviews.      Happy Holidays!\\xa0              So for the non-A grades, how are they going to be calculated and evaluated? I think it was stated that it might be subjective and such but I could be wrong. Thanks!  Hey Professor,   I am a bit confused about what will and won&#39;t be covered on the exam as I have heard mixed information about it. I was curious if Threads, Wait, Lock, Notify, and Exceptions will be on the exam?  Class,      I have written the final. It will again involve mostly coding, and give you a chance to fix many of the style issues some of you faced in the midterm. So understand the assignments you did and the theory behind it.\\xa0 Aso review your midterm performance.      The focus will be on MVC to Exceptions.\\xa0   Naturally, you cannot forget what you learned for the midterm.   Undo/redo is not on the exam. I have made the undo/quiz due after the exam in case you want to do it afterward.      You will have 3 hours to do the final, but expect it to take less than an hour if you know what you are doing. As you have so much time, please do not make silly mistakes, and we may not be very understanding about these, as that makes the rubric horribly long.      To save on paper, for those getting early As,\\xa0I will print only the cover sheet, which you can sign.      I plan to be in my office today at 2pm and will be around until 4pm\\xa0at least. If you are getting an early A, please come by to sign the cover sheet.\\xa0      Respond publicly\\xa0to this message if you need further info. I never respond to private messages that would be of interest to the whole class.      Good luck with studying for the final and congratulations to the early As.      Prasun     I just finished going back over the grading again. I think that everything is good now, but please double check to be sure. In particular, make sure that your assignments have been shifted properly if they were supposed to be.  When and where will early A&#39;s be able to sign their final exams tomorrow? Are the recitation slides from the final recitation (in my case last Friday) posted online anywhere? I cannot find them on the main recitation material page. I thought I should take a second look at the review powerpoint we went over which had the most commonly missed quiz questions. I was just wondering when we should expect to get our assignment 12 grades.  Hey when are the gradescope submissions going to be uploaded to Sakai, because I need to know if I got a 95 in the class with the extra credit submission?   Thanks,\\xa0 Shane  Class,      Hope you are staying warm and have power.   Based on messages from you, I extended the deadlines for submissions of extra credit assignments in both Sakai and Gradescope. Apparently, Gradescope seems to be working nicely, and we will use its score if it exists, but\\xa0we need the\\xa0Sakai submission to have your source code as an eclipse project.      So make sure you have both submissions.      Also send a private response to instructors in case you have had trouble with a Gradescope submission.      I have spent the day writing the final. Those who had signed for the Monday exam,\\xa0 If some of you need to leave on Tuesday, let me know, and I can give an early exam then too in case the univ opens then.      Prasun  In class on Tuesday it was mentioned that submissions\\xa0for A10-12 will be allowed up until Saturday night. However, gradescope submissions closed last night. Should they solely be submitted on Sakai?  Class,      If the university closes on Monday, then the early exam is\\xa0 on Wednesday at 2pm.      Pras     Any idea when Assignment 9 will be graded?   Thanks!  How do I figure out if I have an A in the class? I don’t think the total from Sakai is correct, because there are a bunch of 0s for assignments not finished yet bringing the average down, the Final is being calculated as a 0, and the diaries appear to be not just extra credit but 10% of the grade, and they are out of 2,000 so they are low percentages.\\xa0  In the assignment 11 description, it says that we should make a getter for the readonly property, CommandObject. I am really confused on the purpose of this getter. What is Command Object returning / what is its purpose in this assignment?\\xa0 Just noticed that I have a lot fewer points in the Diary Class Q&amp;A category today after the update than I did yesterday. I noticed that some of you might set your diary to be only visible to you and your TA. That might prevent the auto grader from being able to extract your content. If you are doing so, I would suggest to transfer your diary to a new post and post to all Instructors. Question:  What have you learned through class activities such as assignments, praxes, class interaction, lectures,  recitations that would be applicable in a future course, internship, full-time job and research position. Enumerate roughly in order of importance. Answer:   -&gt; Recursive descent parsing is probably the most valuable tool I learned personally, just due to how cool it is. I mean, I can&#39;t of a bunch of reasons to use in the software I work in, since I give predefined commands typically, ie. buttons, but it still is an exceptionally cool computer science topic.   -&gt; I&#39;ve only ever know how to thread things in Python, and Python threading is, at least from what I can tell, fairly different from java threading. Though, obviously, there are similarities, Java multi-threading is significantly more powerful than Python&#39;s. As such it&#39;s quite important that I learned this topic now, as it will, undoubtedly, help me in future projects.  -&gt; MVC is already something I was vaguely familiar with through web development, but the MVC implemented for animation was quite cool to see. It helped express polymorphism in such a way that I had not been able to see in previous projects. The ability to easily add on views and observers to the models made the project modular and that was very neat to see. I submitted Assignment 12 on Gradescope a few days ago and resubmitted a couple times since then. The autograder has not been able to finish running yet. This project doesn&#39;t contain anything different from the other assignments I uploaded (PowerPoint files or anything; I used JPG). Is this a common problem for Assignment 12? Does anyone know how to correct it? Thanks!  Under the grading status post, it says that Assignment 12 will be downloaded today. Does that mean at midnight today or have they already been downloaded? Basically, if I were to submit my Assignment 12 now, should I do it on Sakai as well as Gradescope, or just Sakai? Thanks!  I will be at most 20 minutes late to office hours today to meet with a professor. I am going to add that time onto the end of my regular hours for anyone that needs it. I’ll \\xa0see you all then.  Class,      Based on a detailed look this week at the student grades, I have decided to make the A cutoff the same as I did last year: 95%. This means a larger fraction will get As, as last time, diaries were part of the regular credit and the same set of assignments were worth 10% less. I did make diaries more work this time, so this is fair. Hopefully they helped with learning.      Without grading of\\xa0 A9 or A12 or the two planned extra credit quizzes, ten students are over 100% (highest 119%) and two are between 99 and 100.\\xa0Three students have between 94% and 99% and then the scores are below 90%.\\xa0      You can, of course, calculate your grades yourself. However, to reduce mistakes, I will release the score Sakai calculates\\xa0so you can be sure.\\xa0 A letter grade\\xa0other than A is not as meaningful at this point, as I have not yet decided on the other cutoffs. So ignore non-A grades - I am simply using the cutoffs from last time for these grades without any individual analysis or consideration of gaps - I try to make sure that you do not miss the next higher grade by less than one percent.      For those who know they are getting an A before 10th (we hope to have A9 and A12 graded by then as well as late A10-12 assignments),\\xa0 at 2pm on Dec 10th I am giving an early final for three students outside my office. Feel free to come then to sign the final if you are getting an A.      Congratulations to the early As! And good luck to all for the last sprint before the end of the semester!      Prasun  Class,      As I mentioned in class we have a special take-home question you need to answer about what you learned through class activities. I am\\xa0writing down the question here:      Q What have you learned through class activities\\xa0such as assignments, praxes, class interaction, lectures,\\xa0 recitations that would be\\xa0applicable in a future endeavor\\xa0( course, internship, full-time\\xa0job, app-development project, and research position). Enumerate roughly in order of importance.         Answer in your diary. reproduce the question and give the answer as your answer.      The LAs will grade it during class on Tuesday, so answer it by 11:55pm\\xa0Monday night.      Let me know if you have questions.      Prasun  Can you post the undo/redo powerpoint we went over in class?\\xa0   When I run the tests for Assignment 12, I get the following:\\xa0                     When I try to call the wait methods and proceedAll in my main method, it seems to work fine.\\xa0          I&#39;ve spoken with a few TA/LAs and I haven&#39;t been able to figure out what&#39;s wrong with my code. Has anyone else experienced this?           When is the last day that we would be allowed to turn in the extra credit assignments to be graded by the automatic grader and get those points? It says something like Dec 6th at 1:00 am on gradescope\\xa0but I was not sure if that is what you are going off of.\\xa0  If anyone is seeing an error that says something like &#34;Printed &gt; 2001 messages. Suspect infinite loop or recursion. Please trace method.&#34;, the grader is looking for an interface to grade before grading the other classes. After imports, the interface to be implemented would just look like this:      &#64;Tags({&#34;PaintListener&#34;}) public interface PaintListener extends PropertyChangeListener{ \\t \\tvoid paint(Graphics2D g);  }     I got all scores in Assignment 9 in Local Checks, but when I upload it to grading server, it took me points off for the same suite as appeared in Local Checks. It says &#34;cannot grade in headless mode&#34; but I&#39;ve double checked that there&#39;s no any class trying to created a GUI except the main. How can I make it correct?     Hey Guys,      I won&#39;t be hosting office hours today, but I will be having my last office hours on Friday in  Davis   5051 ! So come on by and we can talk about assignments, or quizzes. I&#39;d also be happy to go over any missed questions from the midterm.      Best,   Chris  I submitted Assignment 10 late on to Gradescope yesterday and it still says &#34;The autograder hasn&#39;t finished running yet.&#34; Is this normal or did I do something wrong with my submission?\\xa0      Edit: Just tried submitting Assignment 11 to Gradescope and I&#39;m getting a &#34;Server responded with 500 code.&#34; error when I try to upload.  I believe that I&#39;ve taken care of everything but some submission time and shifting issues. If you think something is still wrong let me know.      I still need to process late submissions for A8 make sure all the A10 submissions had the right submission graded.        Hi all,   I will be out of town for the rest of the week due to a school event.\\xa0 Therefore I will not be able to hold my office hours today or tomorrow.\\xa0 Sorry for any inconveniences!  Just wondering if I was the only one experiencing this problem, and, if so, how to fix it.      My local checks (regular credit) for A9 are passing but the autograder is not and seems to not be able to find my work. Not sure if this is an error with the autograder or with my code as I didn&#39;t hear of anyone else having this problem.             I refactored my code so that the frame is created in a composer, but the grader still says it &#34;cannot grade test in headless mode&#34;.   Here&#39;s what the grader says:        Since the method does not have a catch block, the program\\xa0has no way to run the catch block of this method (see below).          The program in question does execute the first line of the try block of echolines when run with no argument (see below).        Apparently   &#96;System.getProperty(&#34;user.dir&#34;) &#43; &#34;/resources/robin1.png&#34;&#96;   is causing problems (has been for every assignment), what is everyone else doing that isn&#39;t causing problems? For animating the main class in A9, there are a list of requirements (e.g. assesses the scene object via factory method, calls the controller factory method, etc.) Is it okay to complete most of those requirements in a composer (to make it neater) and call a method (from the composer class) in the A9 main class? It animates properly. I&#39;m just not sure if this is allowed.  Sorry I didn&#39;t get these all done over break, it has been taking longer than I had expected. I&#39;ll try to have them done today or tomorrow.  Both local checks and the grading sever award 20/20 points for the exception suite. However, the grading server complains about:       ExceptionSuite    gradingTools.comp401f16.assignment12.testcases.exceptions.ScanningExceptionTestCase    Exception java.util.concurrent.TimeoutException not instance of class main.ScanningException             Does anyone know what I am missing exactly?  Sorry for not looking into it sooner, I was visiting family and wasn&#39;t watching my email. It looks like the machine the server is on was restarted and I forgot an exit call so the meaningful error for that was replaced with the wrong one.      While it isn&#39;t actually the construct I was using, this is why you always need to remember your  break  lines in  switch / case  blocks.  I dont\\xa0know if the grading server is actually down but it is not letting me access it. It says I am unauthorized even though I have used it last night in the same manner.\\xa0  I thought local check 12 has a bug. But it seems like it doesn&#39;t...  I don&#39;t remember exactly what was said in lecture last week, but what is the policy for turning in assignments 10-12 after the due date? I think it was something about only getting the grade localchecks said, but I don&#39;t remember entirely.\\xa0  Hi,   I&#39;m trying to load the grading server but I&#39;m getting a &#34;problem loading page error&#34; no matter what browser/link/computer I try to access it from. Everything checks out on localchecks, but I can&#39;t check it with the grading server which has produced more nuanced results for me in the past. I&#39;ll upload what I have now on Sakai, but could there be an extension for the late date while the server isn&#39;t working?   Thanks,   Jonathan Segal  The google doc is set to view-only, so I couldn&#39;t put the following there:      You may receive this warning from ObjectEditor: &#34;W*** Received notification(s) for unknown (possibly invisible or unrecognized atomic-shape) property: Radius of object: mp.graphics.AMovingRotatingLine&#64;767e20cf. Ignoring notification.&#34; I was sending a PropertyChangeEvent from setRadius in my rotating line class, however, ObjectEditor expects notifications from only height and width from your rotating line class, so you should send only notifications from setHeight and setWidth.    Statistics, recorded score and feedback for quiz 12.2 are unavailable under &#34;Submitted Assessments.&#34;  Hi all,\\xa0   I am not feeling well today and will not be able to hold my office hours as usual from 11:15-1:15.\\xa0 Sorry for the inconvenience!  Class,      We are getting ready to download A11. Make sure to delete old submissions afteryou resubmit on sakai to make sure we grade the latest one.      Prasun  For the\\xa0grading of Assignment 10,\\xa0we were told that the latest version we submitted would be the one that was graded; however, the feedback that I got doesn&#39;t match up with my latest submission. I know the errors it mentioned are problems I fixed in later submissions. I just submitted it multiple times because I did not know when the assignment would be downloaded.     When I do local checks I get all of the points, but when I run it in the grading server, I get none of the points for the ParsingAtomicCommandTestCase and I can&#39;t figure out why. If anyone has any advice it would be very appreciated.    I am getting points on local checks for the Parser Suite, but the grader is giving me only five points. I have downloaded the new local checks and when I do the test case manually it works.      Edit: This no longer occurs. I did not change any of the code, it just wasn&#39;t causing any problems when I uploaded it again.     In the Basic Recursive Descent Parsing section of Assignment 11, beware of copying/pasting the test commands directly into your command interpreter. I just spent about an hour debugging, only to find out that sometimes when pasting from the Google Doc, there is a mismatch of the quote characters, and it will (at least for me) just hang the program with no explanation.      Make sure to type your test cases yourself!  I am getting full points on local checks, but the grader is not giving me the same message. Which should I trust? If this helps, the error the grader is giving me is that could not get the bridge scene controller, which I don&#39;t understand because I am calling it using the factory method in the main class.\\xa0                 I will cancel my OH on next Tuesday and hold OH on this Friday from 9am to 11am in FB008. If\\xa0FB008 is not available and you don&#39;t see me there, I will be in FB 134, where we held OH for the first couple of weeks.\\xa0  Will the 7-9 pm office hour be held today in Davis? Thanks.  Where are office hours located right now if FB008 is reserved for someone else?  Hello all,      I am in office hours and we can&#39;t figure this out. The SyncAnimationSuite is giving the the error &#34;Child 1 and Child 2 are not synchronized&#34; for the tests, except for Lancelot which works. I have the keyword in the animator method header and each animation method creates a new instance of the Animator. Is there something I am missing?      Thanks!  Part 2, questions 1-5 ask about whether something is printed immediately and eventually after a different something is printed. For these questions do we include those that print immediately in our count of those that print eventually.      EX: &#34;A&#34; is followed by &#34;B&#34; immediately once and then later &#34;A&#34; is followed by &#34;B&#34; three lines\\xa0after.   Would we count the number of &#34;A&#34;s followed by &#34;B&#34; eventually as two or one?      Thank you,      Nalin Gaddis  Here are two bugs in which the local check inputs invalid commands:             Question 8 says &#34;The orginalX variable holds the final X position of the shuttle after the animation finishes.” The answer key says True, but the correct answer is False. The originalX variable stores the initial (or original) X of the shuttle.\\xa0      Question 30 says\\xa0“After removing the inter-thread delay, the loop in animateXFromOrigin() is executed at least once by the second thread.” The\\xa0“answer key” is False, but this is also wrong, the correct answer is true. Removing the delay has the two threads running concurrently, and I put the current thread print statement inside of the loop in animateXFromOrigin(), and both Thread 1 and Thread 2 were calling the loop.\\xa0     Just wanted to know if we can still submit assignment 10 or is it too late?  I am trying to understand what is making the grader think that my assignment has fewer than 7 unique event sources. It&#39;s possible I&#39;m getting something wrong here, but for each avatar in BridgeScene I have these items being observed (Arthur used as example)      scene.getArthur().getArms().getLeftLine().addPropertyChangeListener( this ); //Line   scene.getArthur().getArms().getRightLine().addPropertyChangeListener( this ); //Line   scene.getArthur().getLegs().getLeftLine().addPropertyChangeListener( this ); //Line   scene.getArthur().getLegs().getRightLine().addPropertyChangeListener( this ); //Line   scene.getArthur().getHead().addPropertyChangeListener( this ); //Image   scene.getArthur().getPoint().addPropertyChangeListener( this ); //Point   scene.getArthur().getTorso().addPropertyChangeListener( this ); //Line   scene.getArthur().getStringShape().addPropertyChangeListener( this ); //StringShape   scene.getArthur().getBelt().addPropertyChangeListener( this ); //Rectangle      I created the belt object on the Avatars to see if CheckStyle would say that there were now 5 unique event sources, rather than 4, but there was no change.   \\xa0   This is my output from the grading server.\\xa0       ConsoleSceneViewOutputTestCase     gradingTools.comp401f16.assignment8.testcases.ConsoleSceneViewOutputTestCase     No of unique event sources &lt; 7.

It&#39;s also in my Interface.  Confused and stumped, please assist.  You should be okay to use the server now. Instead of using the old login prompt you will instead be prompted by your browser to enter your onyen and password. There isn&#39;t a timed logout anymore so the only way to guarantee logging out is closing your browser. The logout button still works in the current version of chrome, but not firefox. If anything is acting up please let me know so I can take a look.      I would have preferred to have not needed to debug on the main server, but the 14th was the hard deadline for the change and some configuration has changed since I last tested it elsewhere and this was the only server that would work.  The logon system we currently use is being deprecated this week so I&#39;m in the process to moving the server to use a different once, but I&#39;ll have to do the final testing on grader1.cs.unc.edu so depending on how things go the site may be unaccessible for a while today. I&#39;ll post again when I&#39;m done.  I&#39;m getting this error on local checks as well as the grading server for assignment 10. I did read the Potential Gotchas section of the assignment and in my animateAvatar method in the Animator class I do move the avatar incrementally and call sleep in between as it says to there. Overall, it is sleeping for 6 seconds in the method.   When I run it through local checks it gives me full points for the AsynchronousLancelot test case but not for the others. If anyone has had this problem before or could point me in the right direction I would appreciate that!      16 checks out of 38 failed. Everything is timing out and I don&#39;t understand the problem.         In the instructions for Assignment 8, in the ConsoleScene view, it says that it :\\xa0Provides a parameterless constructor that registers this, the current instance, as a listener of each atomic shape in the scene. The scene is retrieved using its factory method.      Instead of writing out all the code to make it a listener of each atomic shape in the scene, could I use its factory method to register it inside of the composite objects, so that each time for example I create an Avatar object, it automatically registers ConsoleSceneView as a listener of each atomic object of the Avatar?      Is the grading server taking a really long time on assignment 10 for anyone else?   Thanks! When I try and upload the (500Kb) zip file for Assignment 10 on Sakai, the page freezes, and then on reload gives the error message:  Alert: The upload size limit of 200 MB has been exceeded.  Am I doing something particularly stupid, or have the Sakai internals got muddled? My laptop has died, going to cancel the rest of my OH. I&#39;ll be active on Piazza answer hw/lecture related questions until 7!      My laptop is now a ghost? Still spooky.  InheritingBridgeScenePainter does not display the scene correctly and I am receiving this series of errors and I am not sure how to resolve this issue.      I got my assignment 5 back, but there seems to be something wrong with the manual grading (see below). All the elements in my animation are properly connected. It shows the move, scale, and rotate methods properly as well.                There were some repeated questions in 11.1, is this because they should be worth more or wanted to be reiterated or was this just a typo?\\xa0  I&#39;m getting an error from the grading server saying that I should have constructors for the animator and the avatar in the animating command (see below). How do I get rid of the error?         In the assignment description, it says:\\xa0      Storing each registering PropertyChangeListener in a readonly property called PropertyChangeListeners of type List (import java.util.List).         Is this meant to be a property similar to addPropertyChangeListener in the AnObservableLine class in java teaching? but just by adding the listeners to the list rather than to an instance of a class? or is it meant to do something completely different?\\xa0  There are extra credit points for A10 but the entire assignment is extra credit so what would that mean?  If I sacrificed A9 but do it on time, do all of the extra credit on it and get above a 100% would my grade be my percentage minus 100 or am I not allowed to do the extra credit for any points?\\xa0  As the title states. After I press the upload button for the zip file the Sakai web page goes to a white screen and never returns to the submission page. I&#39;ve tried two different computers and still the same result. I&#39;m assuming I should contact Sakai, correct? Also I know the assignment is once late, but I don&#39;t want to hit the second late date since it begins tomorrow, not sure who I should bring that concern up to.  Is this possible or they must be turned in before/on the date.  My thread names are not matching the ones on the quiz.  Class,      I am sure you can think of creative ways to use the forced time off from classes, but my job is to keep make sure you use this time fruitfully for Comp 401!      I suggest, even if you are doing the threads praxis, you look at the video or PPt for threads, before you commit to the quiz answers tonight. I am reproducing the section below:      Also, as office hours are cancelled, do make use of Piazza for questions.      Prasun         Animation: Threads and Command Objects        PowerPoint     PDF     YouTube     Mix        Does condition 2 mean that all office hours today (11/5) are canceled?  Are there going to be quizzes testing materials in extra credit assignments? Also, are there praxes (if that&#39;s the plural form of praxis) made for assignment 10, 11, and 12? Could you tell me the packages if there are?  Just wondering if the extra credit assignments allow for late submissions like regular assignments do? I assumed no since they were extra credit, but just wanted to make sure.  Class,      We have been moved to\\xa0\\xa0Phillips 222 because of\\xa0ACM ICPC.

However, for this issue, since it is getting late, they can email me directly ( andy_brawn&#64;unc.edu ) with the following information:   \\xa0   \\xa0   Name and onyen,   Which of the quizzes they need to have reopened (9.2, 9.3 or both)   They probably should also put COMP401 issue in the subject line.   \\xa0   Thanks,   Andy  I thought we were supposed to have composer classes to make the frame of the UI instead of letting the controllers do that. But check style seems to want the widgets instantiated in the controllers. Do I get rid of my composer classes then? Or do I tag both the controllers and the composers &#34;controllers&#34;?  Class,      Some of you get errors from the grading server but not localchecks. This happens if you violate the following:      Do not create a visible frame in the controller or view or some other object for which you have defined a factory method - our grading server will give a headless exception in that case. The server cannot create a “head” - a user interface - so if some code it executes tries to display a frame, a headless exception is generated by Java.            So if you are getting this error please refactor your code so the UI is displayed in the main method or in a composer.      We will move the early submission date to tonight to account for this.      Prasun      PS:\\xa0Certain tests will not even try to run when in headless mode, they will say so in the message.&#34;Cannot grade in headless mode&#34;  Hey,\\xa0   My quiz 9.2 also autosubmitted Wednesday night, but I can’t figure out how to to use sakai help. There’s not really any section in it for the sakai quizzes on the sakai website. What else can we do so we can take the quiz?\\xa0      EDIT: See Contacting Sakai for help.\\xa0  The grader server returns errors for categories that the local check gives me full scores for (see below). Is this a bug in the grader server or did I do something wrong?      Both of my quizzes that were due on Thursday night just auto-submitted, like the quizzes earlier in the semester.  My bridge scene view shows the knights without their head images (they only have empty rectangles in place of their heads, as seen below). How\\xa0do we add head images to the avatars? Is this related to the headless error that the grader server returns?      Class,      I have uploaded a new localchecks\\xa0jar that fixes a problem with the NewPaintListener test for A9.

(Not coming to OH) Hi all,      I am getting a weird error that pops up when I try to run the assignment: However, when I exit this the program runs as expected. I am passing all of the local checks except for the following: but I don&#39;t know what that means. Me and the two TAs I have talked to about this think these are related but don&#39;t know what&#39;s causing them. Any advice?      Thanks!  I copied the same code that I used in assignment 6 for the bridge scene, avatars, etc\\xa0 for assignment 7, and included the .jpg files for the head pictures on the avatars in a source folder in assignment 7, but when I run the code they aren&#39;t displayed in ObjectEditor. is there anything I should be doing differently?\\xa0  When running assignment9 through local checks BEFORE pressing &#39;Test All&#39;, the grader says:      Test Failed:Method matching addPaintListener not found in class: class mp.view.ObservableBridgeScenePainter%0.0      However I have this method in ObservableBridgeScenePainter, and it is properly tagged as &#34;addPaintListener&#34;.\\xa0      I&#39;m wondering if anyone else is having this problem, and if so how they resolved it.      Thank you,   Nalin  The grader should be working properly for A9 now. Please let me know if anything is wrong.  Instead of making five different classes for each head, why don’t we just make a “Head” class that has an instance String variable for the head image file name?\\xa0   Or better yet: Why don’t we make an Image class with a String instance variable imageFileName that extends bounded shape, so that we can it for both the heads and other images in our scene like the Gorge with Bridge?\\xa0  In Assignment 9, Localchecks gives me this error:      java.lang.AssertionError: Cannot do test interactively when the executing thread is AWT-EventQueue%0.0      when I run the NewPaintListenerTestCase.

Any ideas?      Thanks,   Ben  Question 15 of 17   5.0 Points   APlottedShuttleView is an observer of PlottedShuttleModel.                 True     False            Reset Selection       Dr. Dewan let me know that this question is referring to AnObservablePlottedShuttle when it says &#34;PlottedShuttleModel&#34;. (there is no class with that name, but AnObservablePlottedShuttle is the model).  I believe questions 8 and 10 have the answers marked incorrectly. Where can I find the ABMISpreadsheet?  I&#39;m trying to run the Praxis and I&#39;m missing lectures.interfaces.ABMISpreadsheet.  Within Eclipse, I&#39;ve re-pulled JavaTeachings and everything is up to date.  Still no ABMISpreadsheet.    Thanks in advance! Class,      I know it Halloween night, so please do them early. The second one is only 17 questions and I just released it. The questions in the two quizzes reference the same package-info file, so it is more efficient to do them at the same time. Do them right after 9.1 if possible (due today) as 91.-9.3 are all related.      Prasun  For the line: &#34;Command interpreter has errors property&#34;, the rubric indicates that this is not extra credit, but the notes say that it is and I think that it should be. Just wanted some clarification on this to see what we should be thinking.   Thanks!      Assignment5 is being graded now, and here are some\\xa0issues that I want to mention.   1. Have fewer animations so that you won&#39;t be wasting a grader&#39;s time (some students have some loop that I have to see their code to determine if that&#39;s infinite). Just have some animation, like move an avatar, rotate one arm, done. Ideally, the whole animation shouldn&#39;t be longer than 10 seconds (I may lose patience especially when you move an Avatar around for a long time).\\xa0   2. Run the local checks and check styles before you submit the assignment. Grading is just local checks&#43;check-styles&#43;animation. What you see in grading server(if it&#39;s not down) will likely be the final score you get.   3. Watch your animations. That will\\xa0make your score much higher.\\xa0   4. Have some pause before the animation. I need a little bit time to zoom the OE so that I may miss a few animations if you started it right away. But don&#39;t make that long. 1 or 1.5 seconds will be more than enough. Again, please have shorter total animation time.   5. If you have some questions or want a regrade(especially when I indicate that you can do so or when I said &#34;I can&#39;t tell if you did this) with less penalty, send me an email and I will look into that. Also, you are welcomed to ask if you have any confusions.   Email: jiyu2&#64;live.unc.edu  This is from the TA. Please comment if you disagree:      Dr. Dewan,      I had a few students who still don&#39;t have their main class named properly. Between having 2 assignments back, the autograder, and the assignment descriptions I don&#39;t feel it is worth having them resubmit since there really is no excuse to have it wrong anymore. I still manually did the parts that looked at their main class since that was just to see if they instantiate their ScannerBean, but I didn&#39;t run it since they didn&#39;t give us what we said we would run. In any other class I&#39;ve taken in the department they would have just been getting 0s on the assignments for doing that so it feels fair to start penalizing them for just not reading or listening to us. Is that okay? I also took off half credit for tagging mistakes instead of asking them to resubmit for the same reason. Nothing beyond checkstyle that was incorrect was based on tags and they just need to start paying attention to what they are doing. I was planning on moving to just counting things that fail due to missing/wrong annotations as wrong after this.      Also, what should I do about people whose images aren&#39;t displaying? In all the cases I actually looked into they would have known there was a problem if they had used the grading server even once so I&#39;m not feeling particularly sympathetic.  Hey guys,      If you&#39;ve looked at assignment 8 and you&#39;re pulling your hair out trying to understand who observables are and why they&#39;re personally attacking you, here&#39;s some answers to some FAQ&#39;s to help! Note that the explanations below apply to the classical MVC/Observer patterns but not perfectly to web MVC/Observer patterns.       Terminology       Many people will interchangeably use several terms: (listener, actionable) and (observer, observable). The first pair are the same as the second pair, listener == observer, actionable == observable. I will use the latter below.      Observable/Actionable: an entity that needs to notify other entities. Think of an atomic shape! The arm needs to notify the scene view whenever it changes so that it can display this change! Observables need to hold a list of those that are observing them! So that when they want to notify those listening, they know whose spam box to fill up.      Observer/Listener: an entity that needs to receive notifications from other entities. In assignment 8, the only observer is the scene view. An observer is an entity who is registering itself to the mailing list of some observable. Please pay special attention to the note that avatar is not an observer, scene is not an observer, scene view is the observer. Observers register themselves in their constructor, although registration by method is also an option. If a class does not register itself (with &#34;this&#34; notation), frequently in the constructor, then that class is not an observer.      Is my avatar an observer or an observable? It is actually neither.\\xa0The avatar is a part of the model, but should not be directly observed because the avatar is a composite object with no properties that are not       How the Observer pattern works       An observable might be a part of the model (atomic shapes like a line). An observer might\\xa0be a view (scene view).       Each observable needs to have a list of observers who are &#39;subscribed&#39; to it&#39;s notifications  Each observable needs to have a registration method for adding new observers to it&#39;s &#39;subscription list&#39; of observers   Major key --&gt; composite objects can delegate registration to the objects that compose them     Each observable needs to notify it&#39;s observers when it changes it&#39;s properties     Each observer needs to register itself to the things that it wishes to observe via some object.addListener(this) notation   Major key --&gt; delegation based registration will save you migraine             How MVC Works         If you&#39;re struggling to understand the diagrams on how MVC operates, here&#39;s a short explanation:    Controllers: update a model, they affect the model, they write to the model (Make one in assignment 9)  Views: display a model, they read the model (Make one in assignment 8 and 9)  Models: are a\\xa0collection of objects (Assignments 1-7)       Our scene is a model. We&#39;re constructing a literal scene of objects in some defined manner that have defined relations and connections to other objects that are also inside of that scene. This model ought only be changed (initialization happens in constructors, not directly by controllers) by controllers. We do no directly update models, we use controllers. And the model ought be read by views to be displayed. After we make a change to the model, via controllers, we need to update our views. To update our views we use an observer pattern such that views are observers of the observable model.\\xa0       TLDR    If you&#39;re thinking &#34;Wow Chris, so that&#39;s how you make a clock&#34; then you&#39;re on the right track. Observer/MVC patterns are extremely important in software engineering and almost all companies use them, or a variation.       Observers use observable.addListener(this) notation   Scene View is an observer. Bridge Scene is not an observer     Observables use have a list of listeners and notify their listeners on change of properties (called an event)   ALine is an observable, AVShape is not an observable   AVShape is a composite object of lines, those lines are the observables not the VShape itself        Can composite objects be observables?   Yes, but it&#39;s harder than what we&#39;re doing in this class.     Are atomic objects always observables?   No, but if they&#39;re used within a view then they\\xa0will be.      Assignments 3 and 4 have been released on Sakai. If your assignment says to resubmit something, do it ASAP or I might not notice it for a while.      The most common problems that I saw were all from people not reading the assignment properly. Tags, property names, structure patterns, your main class, and method/constructor signatures need to be exact. Also, don&#39;t forget your interfaces. I&#39;d estimate that between 1/3 and 1/2 of submission still don&#39;t have an interface for their scanner bean or are using class typed variables for the tokens.      A5 is currently in progress.  In the question he asked whether the class notifies the registered observers, and the answer is false.   However, the method of addPropertyChangeListener does notify the observer registered. Is it a paradox?         I am currently trying to avoid the following errors:  Illegal type or call in: illegalTypeImported: (Assignment8.java:5) Used disallowed class data.Table illegalTypeImported: (Assignment8.java:6) Used disallowed class data.SingletonCreator illegalTypeImported: (Assignment8.java:7) Used disallowed class data.TableInterface illegalTypeImported: (ConsoleSceneView.java:3) Used disallowed class data.SingletonCreator illegalTypeImported: (CommandInterpreter.java:3) Used disallowed class data.SingletonCreator illegalTypeImported: (CommandInterpreter.java:4) Used disallowed class data.TableInterface  But I don&#39;t understand why they are happening. Obviously the grading server thinks they aren&#39;t supposed to be allowed for the assignment, but I don&#39;t see a way to do the assignment without importing my table class that I made. Even with the factory, which is also coming up as an illegal import, I still would need to import the interface, also coming up as an illegal import.   Relevant signatures: &#64;Tags({&#34;SingletonsCreator&#34;}) public class SingletonCreator {  &#64;Tags({&#34;Table&#34;}) &#64;StructurePattern(StructurePatternNames.MAP_PATTERN) public class Table implements TableInterface {  &#64;Tags({&#34;Table&#34;}) public interface TableInterface {    Illegal import or call    Illegal import or call test case    Illegal type or call in: illegalMethodCall: (Assignment6.java:27) called disallowed method animateScanner–&gt;Scanner.setScannedString illegalMethodCall: (Assignment6.java:30) called disallowed method animateScanner–&gt;Scanner.setScannedString             Does anyone know why I am getting this illegal call on the grading server? We are supposed to use setScannedString() to show the animation in the main method and everyone I&#39;ve talked to is not getting this error.

This issue is only found by the grading server, local checks work fine. I call the move method, which is tagged correctly, in multiple methods in the BridgeScene class so I&#39;m not sure why the grading server isn&#39;t picking up on it. The methods I use the move method in all work fine as well. I talked to a couple TA&#39;s but they were not able to see an obvious problem with my code.   Hey Guys!      I&#39;ll be hosting office hours from now on, on Wednesdays from 7-9pm and Fridays 4-6pm in Davis! Check out &#64;9 for the latest room I&#39;ll be in. For this week it&#39;ll be Davis 4046 and 4048.      Good luck with the assignments! Swing by if you&#39;re stumped.  On Question 2 of Quiz 8.1, are the answer choices supposed to have checkboxes (to allow for multiple correct answers)?   I ask because of the wording of the question, and also because Question 6 (same question, but on AnObeservableLine) uses checkboxes.      See below      In ANonObservableLine, which methods are aware of the user-interface code (OE frames) displaying a line object:             A. The main method.      B. animateLine()      C. equals()         Reset Selection       Thanks!   -----------   A similar clarifying question on Question 1:   * In ANonObservableLine, which of the following is required to  animate  the line in   * a third editor:  *   * (a) The header of animateLine() must be changed.  * (b) The body of animateLine() must be changed.  * (c) None of the above.      Does &#34;animate&#34; mean to move the line (as opposed to only displaying the line)? If so, could you confirm whether the question should be single choice or checkboxes?  I&#39;m getting almost all the points on local checks for the Token History extra credit but for all the test cases within that, I&#39;m missing points for the array size being incorrect. I couldn&#39;t find anything in the assignment 6 requirements that mentioned a specific array size so I&#39;m not sure how to fix this issue. I had set my array length to 100 because I remembered in assignment\\xa04, a statement saying that we could assume the max number of tokens in a scanned string to be 100. I am also attaching the trace screenshots for the test cases.      Location: Outside my office, FB 150   Time: 11am, Monday 10/22      I have sent also individual\\xa0messages to the 4 students taking it, please respond with a private message that you will be there.  When making calls with to Table avatarTable, I&#39;d like to make calls in the form of avatarTable.get(name), where name is a String. I am using an ArrayList&lt;String&gt; to store keys, and ArrayList&lt;Object&gt; to store values. My implementation of get(String string) calls contains(Object o) from ArrayList, which checks to see if there&#39;s an object &#34;e&#34; in the list equal to &#34;o&#34;. However, I&#39;d like contains(Object o) to check to see if there&#39;s a\\xa0 String  object &#34;e&#34; in ArrayList such that o.equalsIgnoreCase(e) returns true - this would allow the name I pass through avatarTable.get(name) to be case insensitive.      One solution I thought of was to subclass ArrayList and then override contains(Object object) to use equalsIgnoreCase (with appropriate checks to see if they&#39;re String objects). I was wondering if this is good style, or if there&#39;s a better solution.      One idea that gets around subclassing ArrayList is something like\\xa0      String wordText = nextToken.getInput(); Avatar currentAvatar = null; if (wordText.equalsIgnoreCase(&#34;Arthur&#34;)){//&#34;front end&#34; case check \\tcurrentAvatar = (Avatar) avatarTable.get(&#34;Arthur&#34;); } ... other cases   But what I&#39;m seeking is something of the form   String wordText = nextToken.getInput(); Avatar currentAvatar = null; currentAvatar = avatarTable.get(wordText); //case check included in get(String str)   which is cleaner and more robust.  I am getting this response when running local checks on my assignment 6. I only started getting this error when I fixed another part of my program until then I was getting full points on the InitialBridgeSceneSuite. I&#39;m not quite understanding what the problem is now if someone could help clarify that would be much appreciated. After approach is called occupied is true and getKnightTurn is false.   For assignment 7, I am passing all the run tests and when I scroll over where the string should be shown in object editor, it says the object is there, but it is invisible to me. I&#39;m not sure what I should do to fix this. Everything says that the string is there, but I cannot see it next to the avatar.\\xa0  I was wondering if any of the TA&#39;s have office hours tomorrow. I saw a couple cancelations, and wasn&#39;t sure how the schedule will work.  Class,      At\\xa0least three students need to take the exam later. So please do not discuss it\\xa0among yourselves until we officially discuss the exam, hopefully, next Tuesday.      Late exam takers,      Two of you have posted Piazza messages.The student who showed me a medical letter just before exam\\xa0- please post a private message on Piazza with your name.       Ask ARS to schedule the exam before class time on Tuesday - ideally Monday -. If they do not agree, contact me       You will need to schedule the exam with me. Monday is the latest for it. ARS will not schedule the exam. The undergraduate testing center will, but they have no open dates before Tuesday.      Prasun.  I will cancel my office hours for now and future and shift to grading. Another LA will take my position. I have caught the flu, and am not sure if it is a good idea to come in for the exam tomorrow due to contagiousness and being in too bad of a condition to concentrate on the test. Although I thought I would be able to take the test earlier today, my symptoms have suddenly gotten worse (as symptoms of the flu usually come suddenly). Are there any makeup days for the exam if we bring in a note from campus health? Hi all!      In light of fall break and the midterm, I&#39;m cancelling OH on Wednesday 10/17. I will also not be having OH on 10/22 (Monday following fall break) since I will be in DC for work. Instead, I will hold OH on Tuesday 10/23 from 1:00 to 3:00 PM, to make up for 10/17 and 10/22 missed hours.      Best,      Sarah     Class,      1. Assuming your email is  onyen&#64;live.unc.edu, \\xa0I have added you to Gradescope, and you should have received confirmation.  Let me know if you have not and if so, please respond to this message with your correct email.       2. I\\xa0just committed to the exam, and based on the problem I chose, you have 60 (out of 80) points for writing code. Do not get intimidated by that, there are a large number of requirements, you will partial credit for meeting part of them. The problem is based on the assignments you have done and exercises referenced in the quizzes. Make sure you understand the code and concepts in them.      3. You may want to get scratch paper or at least a good eraser.      I will add to this message in case I think of something else, so please\\xa0keep monitoring it.      Good luck studying for the exam!      Prasun  I see old exams 1 &amp; 2 on the course site, but I didn&#39;t see any associated solutions posted with them. (I checked Sakai as well) Are there solutions somewhere I&#39;m not seeing or could those be posted for us to check our answers as we study? Thanks!  On the 2016 fall midterm, the first question\\xa0says to implement methods that have default access. Therefore when I created an interface for that class I did not include the methods because that would be changing the visibility of the methods to public which the instructions say not to do. However, when I created an instance of the object in the main class to test it and made it of the interface type I am not able to use the default methods. I don&#39;t see how you could use default methods and create objects of the interface type and use the default methods. \\xa0Am I missing something?  Is there anywhere a guide to all the style rules we have learned so far or do we have to dig through the praxes to find them?\\xa0  When I restarted my computer my eclipse workspace appears like this:      The powerpoint from recitation on Friday is on the bottom of the recitations page now.  So say I have class AObject which implements interface IObject. Then I create class AThing which extends class AObject, which adds no new public methods, it only overrides methods from AObject.      Under the style rules should AThing also implement IObject, or is extending AObject enough for the style rules?  Will inheritance be on the exam? I know Professor Dewan mentioned something about it in class, but I can&#39;t remember if he said if it would be on the exam or if it wouldn&#39;t.\\xa0 Just to be clear, does that mean I skip assignment 12 and assignment 5 due dates are due on assignment 6&#39;s dates (I missed assignment 4 deadline and need more time for assignment 5)? should we write and implement interfaces where appropriate on the exam?  Class,         At least one student could not book a place with ARS for the exam.   Others may also be in this situation.      I plan to come 15 minutes early and will stay until the next class starts.   So if you need extra time, especially if it is officially approved by ARS, contact me when I arrive and see if you can start the exam early and I will collect it as late as I can.      Also, those who officially are approved by ARS can walk with me to my office and use additional time there.      Prasun           Question 16 had a typo, but when you corrected the typo, you made Question 15 0 points instead of Question 16.\\xa0      Question 25 asks which implementation of the addElement() method would be invoked on a variable typed as AnInheritingStringSet, and the answer says it would be the implementation in AnInheritingStringSet.\\xa0      Looking at the type hierarchy for AnInheritingStringSet, though, I thought that a variable could be typed as AnInheritingStringSet but assigned an instance of AnObservableStringHistory, so wouldn&#39;t that mean the implementation of addElement() in AnObservableStringHistory would be called?\\xa0  Will we still have recitation on Friday since its University Day, I&#39;m not sure how it works.  I&#39;m not 100% sure, but it seemed like the wording on this was off:   In\\xa0Question 1, Part 4, Quiz 6.2, the method member() is also not working, since it calls the size variable which is initialized again(to 0) in the Database class, resulting in a false return value all the time.             Sorry about the last minute notice. My office hour today will start at 2:00 due to appointment.  I will keep my regular office hours this week.  I&#39;m trying to import\\xa0java.awt.Color in assignment 6 to color my bridge but checkstyle says it&#39;s an illegal import. Are we not allowed to import colors?  This will probably not affect a lot of you, but I will be moving my office hours for tomorrow from 1:00-2:00 to 5:00-6:00, doubling with Jacob. Thanks.  FIXED   If interface I extends interface J, and class C implements I, then A must implement the methods:       This question seems worded poorly. What does A refer to?   If class C1 implementing I1 is a subclass of C2 implementing I2, then I2can be a subtype of I1.       The answer given by the quiz is true, but I thought this would be false because I2 would be a supertype, not a subtype of I1. I&#39;m unsure what I&#39;m misunderstanding here:  &#34;Given a history implemented using a single array object,  it is possible to access each element of the underlying array using public methods of the history.&#34;   The code indicates, that yes, it can:   &#34; public String elementAt (int index) { \\t\\treturn contents[index]; \\t} &#34;  will return the values passed the actually added values. The readings contradict this when defining history,  &#34;we need operations to: \\uf0b7 add an element to the collection, \\uf0b7 examine each element of the collection so that we can print it. &#34; but does that mean that ABaseStringHistory isn&#39;t a proper history collection or that the readings have a improper definition?I believe in order to properly animate the movement (at least the way I&#39;ve set it up) I need to refresh the object editor within the approach method, however, and unable to do so unless I can define an argument that does so. However, the assignment doesn&#39;t explicitly state that I can. I followed the code on the composites powerpoint instructions on how to get height/width of an image, but everytime it runs, it says that the height and width is -1. what would be wrong with my code?\\xa0   this is a screenshot of the powerpoint slide if this helps\\xa0     Local checks cannot find RotateLeftArm but can find the rest of the regular and extra credit command classes. Any idea why? I checked to make sure &#34;RotateLeftArm&#34; is spelled correctly. This question reads: &#34;Given a history implemented using a single array object,   it is possible to access each element of the underlying array using public methods of the history.&#34;      The answer to this is false, even though ABaseStringHistory has this method:   public String elementAt (int index) { \\t\\treturn contents[index]; \\t}   Which would return any element in the contents array, which seems to imply the answer is true.  Class,      Per university\\xa0rules, the first recitation will begin 10 minutes later.      Also a reminder that I am out of town this week, so no office hours from me this week.      Prasun  Hi all, I forgot to post immediately to piazza, but since pearl hacks is using my normal office hours location, I will be holding office hours today, 10/1, in the sitterson lounge. Sorry for the inconvenience.  Question #16 for the quiz is &#34;The ObjectEditor tree view can be used to determine if the displayed object is a tree or not.&#39;      I find this confusing, because ObjectEditor will display a dag or a graph in the tree view, but will display non-leaf nodes as leaf nodes instead. However, without a knowledge of the physical structure one has know way of knowing if these are actual leaf nodes or leaf nodes because of a non-tree structure. How is one supposed to determine if ObjectEditor is showing a tree or a DAG?          Sorry about the confusion! the office hour is not changed until next week!      Starting next week, my office hours will be cancelled on Monday and Wednesday. Tuesday office hour will be moved to 3-5pm.  Hi all,\\xa0   I am not feeling well, so I will need to cancel my office hours for today.\\xa0 Sorry for any inconveniences!\\xa0 I will hold my normal office hours for the rest of the week.        I am a bit confused about the following statement from the assignment 5 document:   &#34;Any import that does not start with mp (For Monty Python) or grail (for Holy Grail) will be classified as a foreign import and will be considered illegal unless explicitly allowed.&#34;      Does this mean something like javax.swing.Icon (which was used in the lecture code) would be illegal in the Image class? Does it apply to StructurePattern and Tag imports? I also don&#39;t understand how/why I would import something from within the same package of a class?\\xa0 May I shift my Assignment 1 due date to today? I&#39;ve already completed and submitted it, I just didn&#39;t know if I needed to ask to shift or if it shifted automatically. Thank you! For the rotating line, does local checks expect the radius to stay the same while it rotates? I&#39;ve been struggling with this because the trig functions won&#39;t\\xa0return ints and when I use casting, it is rounding the numbers making the radius not stay the same the whole time, which I&#39;m guessing is why local checks is telling me my height and width is wrong. Is there a special rounding technique we should be using for this part? I was wondering where the extra points of the diary posts go.  I know that each question and answer from the lecture earn us 5 extra credit points, but how exactly does that factor into our grade? Are those points added to our assignments? Thanks! Hey all, due to a class make-up I have from 3:35-4:50 tomorrow, I will be\\xa0modifying my office hours to be from 2:20 to 3:30 and from 4:55\\xa0to 6:20.      Cheers,   Jed I&#39;m trying to create a circle, which I&#39;m guessing uses the OVAL_PATTERN, and don&#39;t know the property names ObjectEditor requires to render it. I tried &#39;Radius&#39;, &#39;X&#39; and &#39;Y&#39;, but no dice.   Does anyone know where I can look to find these? I am really confused on how to start assignment 5. I know we are supposed to create two more packages besides main, but what is supposed to go in them? Does it matter? and is there specific names that these packages are supposed to have?   This sentence on the assignment is really confusing as well:   &#34;How exactly you do the division is up to you, but the classes in the same package should share one or more properties not shared with classes in other packages.&#34;  Dr. Dewan,   \\xa0   Please let students know that they should uncomment the initialization of the location variable in the ALineWithObjectProperty class.   \\xa0   This will make the ADagCartesianPlane class work as it is intended to in the lectures.composite.tree_dag_graph_objects_windows Praxis.   \\xa0   Thanks,   Lainey Miller  In the praxis preceding question 5, the comments detail how to navigate the tree in the variables panel, however it seems that something has changed. Instead of finding elementData, you have to navigate through elements named [0] or [1], looking at the type on the left side. Within those, you can see their components under &#34;components&#34;. Professor Dewan asked me to post an example of how I navigated to a JTextField instance:      splitPane -&gt; component -&gt; [1] -&gt; component -&gt; [0]  The following is copied from the praxis:\\xa0      public class ALineWithObjectProperty implements LineWithObjectProperty { \\tvar declarations... \\tpublic ALineWithObjectProperty(Point initLocation, int initWidth, int initHeight) { \\t\\tlocation = initLocation;\\t// comment this out on the second run \\t\\twidth = initWidth; \\t\\theight = initHeight;\\t \\t} \\t \\tpublic Point getLocation() {return location;}\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t// a non-primitive property! \\tpublic void setLocation(Point newVal) {location = newVal;} \\t \\tpublic int getWidth() {return width;} \\tpublic void setWidth(int newVal) {width = newVal;} \\tpublic int getHeight() {return height;} \\tpublic void setHeight(int newHeight) {height = newHeight;}   Aren&#39;t Width, Height, and Location all bean properties (since they have getters)?

All this does is call is the run method without creating a new thread. Your animation should have shown at least two avatars animating at the same time on the screen.      Andrew  Class,      Yesterday (Saturday) I made some more corrections to A12 to make naming of tags and parse methods consistent with what we had in A11. Again, these were done with track changes on. Three tags that had CommandObject now have Command as a suffix. Also a few parse methods now end with Command as a suffix. These all apply to extra credit and will be caught by localchecls.      Also I changed localchecks to identify extra credit\\xa0correctly.      I also corrected the link to the A12 checkstyle\\xa0file which pointed to A11.      Finally in the demo part,, I reversed two steps for those who did lockstep.      Prasun        My programs works basically fine and the tests are all positive except for one:      commandObjects.DefineCallCommandObejctTestCase      The error message says the X of one of the lines is 317, instead of 302.      I just want to know what kind of code is used on this one, for example, what kind of command string does it give, so that I can create my own test and see the details more thoroughly.  Hey Everyone,      Tutoring will be Today (Monday) and Tuesday from 6 - 7:15 (will stay later if need be) in SN047. This will be the last chance before your final to ask questions. I would recommend focusing on conceptual stuff and less on specific assignments at this point, however I would be happy to help with assignments if that is what most people are interested in.\\xa0      best,   Sam     In the assignment pdf, it says to tag the define, call and thread command classes &#34;DefineCommandObject&#34;, &#34;CallCommandObject&#34; and &#34;ThreadCommandObject,&#34; but when ran with local checks, the local check suite reported errors in CommandInterperterSuite and CommandObjectSuiteA12 &#34;no class tagged definecommand,... no class tagged callcommand, ... no class tagged threadcommand.&#34; Removing the word &#34;Object&#34; from the tagged classes resolved these problems, so I was just wondering which one is the correct tag.  I&#39;m getting an error from the auto grader that &#34;Message:Leaf object: mp.AnImage&#64;3c1f0df2 replaced with:mp.ABridgeScene&#64;4eb61ac3&#34;, however my code works as it is supposed to and the animations work, but when I run it through the autograder it&#39;s telling me that my image is being replace by my ABridgeScene class. I went to the TA and he said my code looks fine but wasn&#39;t able to figure out why the error is occuring.  This is the error I&#39;m getting when i run the auto grader. As you can see my AnImage instance moves from (200,20) to (212,33) as it is supposed to before the error occurs.         ObjectEditor(Version 22, built on Wed Sep 07 12:53:46 EDT 2016).

get it working, but it more or less seems to work on my very limited tests (I need to make a fix to record correct grades in Sakai).      To test drive it, go to:\\xa0 https://grader.cs.unc.edu/ \\xa0   authenticate,   select upload from menu bar   fill\\xa0menu entries (Choose Assignment for Type)   chose zip file you would submit to sakai\\xa0(if this works we have a plugin also)   press upload button   pray   see results if you get them.      Currently checkstyel checks will be done only for A10.      I still think it will take a miracle to get it to really work, but life is boring if you do not believe in miracles ..      Prasun        Students,      I&#39;m moving my (last!) office hours today to 5-7pm.      -Assignment 11 will be graded soon. You should have a good idea of your grade from the local checks.   -If there&#39;s anything urgent you should see me in office hours   -If you have issues with local checks/grading you should put it here or send it to the help account, not directly to me.\\xa0Even if I help you, it helps the professor to be aware of the issue. I can tell you I&#39;ve seen A11 and A12 local checks pass on students&#39; assignments.      Andrew     For questions 27-30 what is meant by &#34;an argument of 2&#34;?      Also what is meant by &#34;dynamic dispatching&#34;?  Class,      I just spent an enjoyable afternoon reading your class discussion submissions and have uploaded the grades.      You got some points for attendance which I gauged based on whether I knew your name, how frequently I saw you in class, and whether you were in class the day I took attendance. So if you did sign the sheet and received a 0, send us mail.      Prasun  Class,      The submissions for A1-A11are closed\\xa0at this point.      I saw several of you working on A11 yesterday.      I would suggest taking your chances with the grader server and trying to get your assigments graded through it if you did not get a chance to submit them before the close date. if you are successful (there is no time to fix iteh server), take a screen shot of your grade and more important send us mail about which ones were graded.      If we have time to process your mails, we will take this into account in the fudge factor.      I would recommend doing this only if you have completed assignments, not if you plan to complete them at the expense of other courses as I do not trust the server.

space on campus to try and go over the practice exam? If so shoot me an email at  jjahuja&#64;live.unc.edu \\xa0and Ill send out more information.  Class,      1. Please bring scratch paper or an erasable\\xa0dark pencil - as in the midterm you will have plenty of time.   2. The instructions have changed, so read them carefully.   3. The biggest change is that the question and answer parts are separate. You can keep the question part. The answer part is 6 pages.   4. You get 5 points\\xa0for writing your name and initials in capitals.   5. Please keep monitoring this post as I might add to this list.      Prasun  I forgot to submit assignment 12 last night, is there any way I could still turn it in?  Class,         I fixed a problem with the way I had named A12 (It had a &#34;/&#34; in the name which was causing problems) and so the grading server is behaving better.      Three different students have submitted closed assignments using it today.      I just wanted to let you all know in case you tried and saw a message &#34;so many people in the queue before you&#34;.      If you are able to successfully use it for a submitted assignment, please send us mail (the help alias) with the header: &#34;CLOSED ASSIGNMENTS&#34; with a screen shot of the results, the assignment numbers, and the times you submitted the assignments. If we get time we will look at the log and your message, especially if you are on the borderline.      The three of you who sent mail today, please forward the mail with the correct subject line to the help alias.      Again,good luck with preparing for 401 and other exams!      Prasun  #2 C &amp; D:   Do both threads start at the same time? causing them to run the run method and get into the wait()?    Median 297/362      Good luck on your exams!   comp401-002-f16&#64;cs.unc.edu \\xa0is the list serve email address, thus we all get emails sent to that address.       help401-002-f16&#64;cs.unc.edu \\xa0is the email address to which we are supposed to direct questions regarding grades, and where screen shots should be sent from the online grader.\\xa0  Fewer people turned this one in and there were a lot of extra credit points.. Of those who did: average 155/85.     I was just wondering when should we expect to get our grades back for the late assignments that we turned in? \\xa0I haven&#39;t gotten any assignments backs since assignment 6 because I turned them in a little late but it has been a while since I turned them in.      Thanks!  Everyone accidentally got 15% off their A12 so we adjusted the total points to be 72  Class,      1 Grade the exams.   2. Grade the late assignments - remember there is no disputing with them. - whatever the autograder\\xa0gives is what we are required to give.   3. Process all individual emails about valid grading issues,   4. Process individual emails about issues with mistakes you made or post-close date submissions, which will be done mainly for borderline students.   5. Give final grade.      We are shooting for finishing 1-4 by noon tomorrow.      Prasun       Not sure why the local checks test for bridge scene controller does not work. It works when I manually interact with it.\\xa0      This is the error given by that test suite in particular (after it automatically runs the observable painter test):      ObjectEditor(Version 22, built on Sat Nov 19 11:40:44 GMT-05:00 2016).

BridgeSceneControllerSuite: 0.0  Hello Everyone,      Hope you guys had a good break. I&#39;ll be holding tutoring on Monday and Tuesday this week from 6-7:15 in SN047. This seems to accommodate some peoples schedules better. Again you can always email me with questions.\\xa0      Sam     Package: lectures.exceptions   Quiz: Exceptions    &#34;Subscript checking is inefficient if programmers code carefully enough to never get an error.&#34;      By error, they mean subscript error.  So do we have to resumbit all of our participations in class into Take 2? I&#39;m assuming that for the original discussion the files were overwritten everytime a new thing was submitted.   I have a few of them in my records, but I don&#39;t have some of the early ones.  The final due date for assignment 4-9 is November, 30 2016 11:55 pm. I thought that the final resubmission\\xa0date for all assignments except Assignment 12 is Dec. 4th/5th? Is there any way that can be changed, I&#39;d like to resubmit some assignments for extra credit.\\xa0    Hello, for the method hasNext(), I can&#39;t seem to be able to implement a correct way of identifying if the next token in an array exists or if peek() will throw an out of bounds exception. Are we supposed to use peek() in the method of hasNext()?  In the ObjectHistoryUser class in the praxis, one of the question is swapping the two addElement&#39;s and another question is swapping the two prinln&#39;s. However, originally one of each is commented out, we are supposed to first uncomment then swap the order right?    Will our recitation grades be based solely on the quizzes? There were prior assignments that don&#39;t seem to be accounted for.        Class,      Generics and adapters now show feedback.      Based on a request from a student, I have updated the due dates of all assignments after #2 to Dec 5th.      Prasun  Are on the web. Also for those who started during the break, I made some tracked changes to the assignment\\xa0during the break. So do make sure you look at the latest version  Should the key of the table still be a String or should it be a generic parameter as well?  I&#39;m getting weird errors in my Recitation 12 code. For example it&#39;s asking me if I want to create a class called Object on one of the object arrays (which is hilariously absurd). I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s the project or my eclipse? Every other one of my projects are working fine.\\xa0  In the Assignment 12 document, it tells us to basically copy the clearance manager from the JavaTeaching package. \\xa0This clearance manager does not have a proceedAll() method. \\xa0In implementing this method are there any particular ways we should broadcast that the method is called? \\xa0Should we just have it broadcast basically the same as the other methods? \\xa0i.e.:      System.out.println( Thread.currentThread() &#43; &#34;: before proceedAll&#34;); [code]  System.out.println( Thread.currentThread() &#43; &#34;: after proceedAll&#34;);   or something like this?      Just realized that there is ABroadcastingClearanceManager which extends the clearance manager I was looking at and includes a proceedAll() method, but there is still no broadcast in this method - does this mean we don&#39;t need one?  Hi. Are the two tables, i.e. the one for string-command correspondences and the one for name-avatar correspondences, the same instance of &#34;Table&#34;, or two different instances?      Based on the homework pdf, which says:   &#34;Use generics to define your table class and elaborate this class with different type parameters to (a) map avatar names to avatars and (b) implement the extended grammar with define and call commands (if you do the extended grammar, see section on extended grammar below). &#34;,   I assume they are two instances of the\\xa0Table class.      So now that there are two instances, does the SingletonsCreator creates the avatar table or the command table?      Based on former assignments, I guess SingletonsCreator creates the avatar table.       So just to make sure, we\\xa0don&#39;t have to make another factory method to create the command table, correct?  The homework pdf specifies the parameter(s) of the constructors of the command classes.      I&#39;m wondering, are we allowed to have multiple constructors with one of them in accordance with the spec?  I know we declare the methods in the abstract classes, but do we define the methods in there as well (not abstract methods)?\\xa0  Hey Everyone,      I&#39;m on vacation this week so I will not be tutoring Today or Wednesday. Sorry for the late notice, forgot to post this morning. I will have hours next week when everyone returns and possibly extra hours closer to the final in order to accommodate final review. Have a good break everyone!      Sam     I&#39;m getting two kinds of errors in my LocalChecks. The first one is saying that when it a runs a command, my X-value in the Line class is off. The other is saying that my when my asynchronousArthur() and asynchronousLancelot() is called at the end of the test, they are in sync... I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s an error in part or not because I felt I did this part correctly. Any guidance would surely help.

I&#39;m getting a No Such Method error with respect to the constructor (I think) on the Repeat Command Object Test Case. All of my other test cases are passing with the exception of this one and I&#39;m not sure why... I have the class tagged\\xa0&#64;Tags({&#34;RepeatCommand&#34;}) which I believe is the correct tag, so I&#39;m not quite sure why this is failing. I&#39;ve attached a picture of the error for reference.\\xa0      Also, my constructor takes two parameters, an int numTimes and a Runnable command, in that order, which I believe is how it&#39;s specified in the assignment.\\xa0       error.PNG   Package:\\xa0lectures.generics_adapters   Quiz:Generics and Adapters  Any idea what this\\xa0error is from? The first runTest for Arthur from\\xa0the commandinterpretermoveTest works correctly,\\xa0but the other ones do not and this is the error when I try to run\\xa0Galahad individually.           What is the difference between B and C? Is C stating that X animation will not start while Y animation is concurrent?      &#34;The three animators             A.\\xa0run serially, that is, while one animator is executing, other animators wait.      \\xa0B.\\xa0animate in the Y direction serially, that while one animator is animating in the Y direction, the other animators do not animate in the Y direction.      C.\\xa0animate in the X and Y direction serially, that is while one animator is animating in the X (Y) direction, the other animators do not animate in the X (Y) direction.        D.\\xa0run without any coordination.&#34;            While I am passing the SyncAnimationSuite part of the LocalChecks, I get an exception whenever it does the SyncArthurLancelotTestCase. I gave each avatar its own animator object. I narrowed it down to my ThreadSupport.sleep(time) method. I tried commenting it out, resulting in failure. I keep the time within 10000 ms (10 seconds) and it still causes a InterruptedException. Is there something I am missing here?      \\xa0   ### gradingTools.comp401f16.assignment11.sync.testcases.SyncArthurLancelotTestCase: 1.0   Calling on object class grail.misc.ASingletonsCreator

Median (of those students) 105/110      For those of you turning in assignments very late (after the other students get their grade for the assignment):      -Your assignments will be automatically graded only (you won&#39;t get points for the manual checks)   -I strongly suggest you use the local checks   -Make sure you don&#39;t have illegal imports, magic numbers, and classes as types instead of interfaces    To what extent do we have to actually implement our abstract classes that we create? The assignment prompt gives no directions on this, it just states to create an abstract class for the token and shape hierarchy.  I&#39;m getting a weird &#34;NoSuchMethodException&#34; when running the Say Command Object Test Case, \\xa0it reads as follows:      Test Failed:java.lang.NoSuchMethodException mp.commands.SayCommand.&lt;init&gt;(mp.tokens.Token, java.lang.String)      Maybe I&#39;m misinterpreting this but I thought the constructor was not supposed to take Tokens as arguments but it looks like the test case is trying to initialize it with one. Either way, I&#39;m not quite sure what the error means.      For reference, I downloaded the checks tonight, so they are up to date, and my Move Command Object Test Case passes with flying colors. I&#39;ve also attached a screenshot.       error.PNG     &#34;Example of use of this feature: {move guard &#43;10 -100 rotateRightArm guard -9} The second command above assumes you have done the extra credit mentioned below.&#34;      Does this mean we have to create respective rotate commands for Extra Credit on this assignment? It is not mentioned aside from this example so it is confusing whether or not its part of the actual assignment.  Will the local checks be available before the early submission deadline tonight?    Would we have to deal with such a case like this:      { command command command { command .... } }\\xa0  Hi, in some previous assignment, I implemented some error resilient mechanism of the command interpreter with a error property of type List&lt;String&gt;, and OE sends warning of sending notification of composite property. Is it fine to ignore such warning?    A11&#39;s checkstyle file gives the same false negatives or error statements that contradict the assignment parameters.(For instance importing component from prior assignments is considered illegal.)  Class, the package is:\\xa0      lectures.animation.threads.synchronized_methods      The quiz is:\\xa0Animations: Synchronized Methods      We hope to add another praxis and quiz \\xa0on the related idea of wait/notfy before the class is over  In InterferingConcurrentShuttleAnimation, the animation may not run because in the last praxis (ctrl &#43; click on concurrentDemoShuttleAnimation in main), the &#34;correct&#34; constructor for the Thread (the one with the animator) was commented out. Uncomment that and the InterferingConcurrentShuttleAnimation should run.  Another praxis, also due after Thanksgiving is added to JavaTeaching. It is in package:      lectures.animation.threads.wait_notify.lock;      The quiz on Sakai is called &#34;Wait, Notify, and Locks&#34;  For this particular question in the Synchronized Thread Praxis there can be more than one answer:      (T/F) After removing the inter-thread delay, the loop in animateXFromOrigin() is executed at least once by the second thread.  Minor corrections for A11:      1. The command examples use &#34;passed&#34; and &#34;failed&#34; as commands. These should have been &#34;pass&#34; and &#34;fail&#34;   2. The signed number extra credit example uses a rotateRightArm command. This is implemented in the next assignment, not this one. Also, there should have been spaces between the tokens. The example should have been:   { move guard &#43; 10 - 100 move arthur - 20 10 }        When do\\xa0all late assignments for the semester need to be submitted by?  I&#39;m not sure I know where the readonly property CommandObject is at? I&#39;m guessing we have to declare it in the Parser class...  Will the parsing methods have parameters?  Class,      I am still working on it, but have meetings in the afternoon in which I hope to complete the command objects. Here is what I have, it uses some nasty commands so do not be surprised if some of them fail, there is enough credit for the simple ones.      As usual, this is symbiotic, I help you test your code and you help me test the tests.      The tests assume:      A failed or passed knight can approach again.      The number of scanned tokens is less than 100 (if I gave you a lower limit (50?) earlier, please bump it, or I will change or\\xa0remove one of the tests.)      Prasun  Could not load class:.\\\\src\\\\grail\\\\CommandList.java ClassNotFoundException CommandList        Got this error in the console while running the RunTest for Assignment 11.\\xa0 How do I go about correcting this?\\xa0 I have a class called CommandList, so I&#39;m not sure why it can&#39;t load.     That leaves synchronized methods, which will be a few hours at \\xa0least    I originally had an error with the local checks related to the repeat commands. This was due to the fact that I had implemented a ThreadSupport sleep within the run of a Repeat Command to emphasize that the animation was being repeated. Upon removing this, the checks worked fine. Should I resubmit my assignment or will it be accounted for?  Hi,      It turned out I had uploaded a version of code in which I had been experimenting with Threads (for writing the last quiz question). It shouldn&#39;t have affected anything besides giving a lot of odd output, but the updated code is now online.      Sorry for the inconvenience,   Semion  Class,      Just uploaded them.      That leaves Parser factory method and parser properties, which I will try and integrate in the parser \\xa0testcases. If I do not get to them by tonight, please check them carefully.      PS; I added the parser method test      Prasun  How could I test this part? In the last assignment I called all 4 methods and it caused all four characters to be animating at the same time. If I did this correctly, then it should animate each character one by one, meaning once one character is done, it&#39;ll jump to next and then so on??  Just added tests to see that parser creates command objects .. t  I ran into this problem with A11&#39;s SyncAnimationSuite, if the animator&#39;s total runtime is greater than 2000ms, then runtime checks would just kill it and does not wait for the animation to finish, resulting in failed test for potentially correct code. If you think this is the case for your code consider changing the runtime length of your animation. I am not sure if this is a bug or intended feature.  I REALLY hope next time the test suite can be made better or the spec can be written in a more precise way.   I have more than one constructor for RepearCommand, one of which takes no argument, and this results in an error which takes me unnecessary 20 mins to fix.  Can I resubmit an old assignment after adding on the extra credit parts to recieve extra credit now?  A word of caution to those of us relying on local checks. The following tests DO NOT have a space after the last token, so if your scanner is not coded to handle this (mine is not), these tests WILL fail even if your parsing is done correctly:   PraserCreatesRepeatCommandObjectTestCase   ManyLevelListMovesTestCase   ManyLevelLevelRepeatManyLevelList      Until the checks are fixed, you will have to manually debug these yourself, using\\xa0the argument the tests use except with the needed space after the last token.  Did anyone run into issues with the RepeatCommandObjectTestCase? I get the following error and I have no idea if it&#39;s the local checks that&#39;s calling something wrong, if I&#39;m missing a class, if something might be tagged wrong, or something else entirely....      ### gradingTools.comp401f16.assignment11.commandObjects.testcases.RepeatCommandObjectTestCase: 1.0   Test Failed:java.lang.NoSuchMethodError util.introspect.JavaIntrospectUtility.getConstructorISA(Ljava/lang/Class; Ljava/lang/Class;)Ljava/lang/reflect/Constructor;%0.0   ### gradingTools.comp401f16.assignment11.commandObjects.testcases.RepeatCommandObjectTestCase: 0.0  I was curious. \\xa0When repaint is called on a view, it should call the paint method of that same view. \\xa0   So for example, when repaint is called on the avatar View, every time a propertychange event happens, then repaint should be called on the Avatar causing it to paint that new event in the window. \\xa0Is that how it should work?  After seeing my grade returned for Assignment 7, I did some investigating and realized I accidentally turned in a rough draft that contained a null pointer exception preventing the main method from running. \\xa0I understand that this was an embarrassingly careless mistake on my part but is there any way to re-submit this and earn any credit back (at-least in the auto-graded parts)? This was a fairly heavily weighted assignment and it&#39;s taking a huge toll on my grade.    Assignment 7 gives the same issue on feedback that Assignment 6 did, no actual point breakdowns, just blank space with a random loss shown. See below: 20161106_2.png   Hey Everyone,      Tutoring will be Monday and Wednesday as usual this week. Monday will be from 6-6:45, Wednesday will be from 6-7:15. SN047      Sam       Are we permitted to pass parameters to these methods?  Java Package:\\xa0lectures.inheritance.abstract_classes   Sakai Quiz: abstract classes  Students,      Due to a small hiccup, many of you did not get the breakdown of your grade for A7 in your feedback file. I have uploaded the full feedback files on Sakai in a separate read-only assignment called &#34;Assignment 7 Feedback&#34;. Use the breakdown from that feedback file,  except the last two   checks  you will have 0 points but in your actual grade, they were not 0 because those were manual checks.      The problem has been fixed and won&#39;t happen in future assignment feedback files.      Andrew       A lot of the checks on A10 are giving false negatives or are triggering warnings for items that are permitted as per the assignment directions.

See console output%0.9736842105263158&#34;      The area of interest is how local checks requires that preFailed after the Guard say be false. \\xa0According to the assignment 6 instructions where we first implemented failed, it&#39;s supposed to be able to fail either the Guard or the Knight standing based on who&#39;s turn it is to speak. Therefore, wouldn&#39;t the precondition only be that the knight area is occupied prior to executing fail? Furthermore, if this is the case, executing a say method wouldn&#39;t change the occupancy of the knightarea. Additionally, the knight area would have to be occupied in order for say to be executed to begin with. Wouldn&#39;t this mean that the idea that preFailed must be false after a Guard say is wrong?  Say I have a precondition for a method that is something like (a &amp;&amp; !b). \\xa0If another method says something like b = true, then clearly this precondition is now false, but if another method says b = false, then should we check a and only fire an event if a is true?      Actually, I think a is a precondition to the only method that sets b = false, so I think I don&#39;t need this. \\xa0You can disregard this question  Class,      They are on the web.      They assume that the tags and names and methods with precondition are the same. So if you have a method tagged approach, the checks assume that it is named approach and more important, its precondition is named preApproach. In case the name is different, it should be a small matter to rename the methods. Look at the precondtion test output carefully, it has 36 checks, worth 2 points each.      Again, let me know of false positives and negatives.      The tests are not comprehensive, there will be manual grading of console view and extra credit.      Prasun  In some of my say, approach, etc. methods I have if-else statements. How would one assert those? I know how to assert a simple if statement but it gets more messy when you have more conditions.      Example:   say method:   Occupied has to be true &amp;&amp; knightTurn has to be false so that the guard can speak   Occupied has to be true &amp;&amp; knightTurn has to be true so that the knight can speak      Do I have to test every condition or for this example or just test (assert) the Occupied value and then carry on with the rest of my code?          For the animation praxis is there anyway to jump straight to the breakpoint and observe what the questions want us to? It&#39;s unfeasible to keep hitting f8 to get to the break point with so many things coming before.  Today&#39;s lecture is really interesting, especially on the subject of parsing.   It never came to me that we can look at concepts like &#34;language&#34;, &#34;sentence&#34;, &#34;phrase&#34;, and etc, from such an abstract and concise perspective.   I&#39;m eager to know more on this topic, such as how to &#34;implement&#34;, or actualize, the grammar rules, how to implement a more general parser suitable for possibly any legal grammar set, how to handle possible ambiguity, how to possibly recover from errors, and more complicated stuff like, natural language.   Do you have any recommendations on maybe some reading materials or some course I can take?  1. for firing the precondition change event new PropertyChangeEvent(...), does that go in the precondition method or in the actual speak, pass, approach, and fail methods?      2. In his example, couldn&#39;t you just call\\xa0new PropertyChangeEvent(this, &#34;this&#34;, &#39;&#39;approach&#34;, preApproach()) instead of\\xa0new PropertyChangeEvent(this, &#34;this&#34;, &#39;&#39;approach&#34;, false) since the new condition value is always returned?  Can the\\xa0Animation: Threads and Commands praxis be extended till tomorrow or Sunday night? It&#39;s a long one so it&#39;s taking me sometime to finish it. Thanks!  Is there anyway you could extend the praxis until tomorrow night? I&#39;m not sure if I can get it done today and I really do not want to rush it.      [Never mind I&#39;m it&#39;s going quicker than I thought.]  Hi Professor,\\xa0      I had a hard time debugging one test that I didn&#39;t pass in the LocalChecks. The test is &#34;MoveCommandObjectTestCase&#34; shown red in the following picture. It shows that there&#39;s a null pointer, but I didn&#39;t find any null pointer in my code. I actually did the move command similarly to the say command. The say command worked, but the move didn&#39;t. I have spent more than 2 hours on this. Is there any chance that you can help me check my code?      Thanks!          Update: Andrew figured it out for me. I forgot to tag the move command.  Page 5 of assignemnt 10 under &#34;Animating/Demoing Main Class&#34;, number 3 says to display our code with the extended console view.      Does this mean that the boolean pre methods should be displayed in object editor? \\xa0Or how do you mean to &#34;display&#34; it?  In question 7 of the quiz, answer B says that order is controlled by lines 33 to 35 in class AScene. \\xa0But, lines 33 to 35 is a getter for the ship image.      Should this say lines 44 to 46 instead?  Hey Everyone,   In light of Halloween and the mess that Franklin will become, there will be no tutoring today. Tutoring will be held on Wednesday in SN047 from 6-7:15.\\xa0   best,   Sam    Given that the key controller portion of this part of the assignment responds to a prior mouseclick, should we write a mouse controller and then have an instance of it in our bridgescene controller?(which is really just a key controller in that case). Or should it be the other way around?(that is, an instance of the key controller in the mouse controller.  Package:\\xa0lectures.animation.threads_commands      Quiz:\\xa0Animation: Threads and Commands  For the questions asking about whether a thread is a &#34;current thread&#34; or a &#34;stopped thread&#34;, current threads are any threads that you can see in the debug window and stopped threads are specifically the threads that are stopped/suspended from your breakpoints and you are able to expand them and see their stacks. All stopped threads are current threads, but not all current threads will be stopped.  For questions 5 and 6, when asked about &#34;the number of Thread objects,&#34; the question means DIFFERENT thread objects, where one object is of form Thread[&lt;Thread Name&gt;]    &#34;Your main code should call methods only in the models. &#34;   Are we allowed to do this in main or do we need to create a specific class for this?    &#34;6.

Important notice:      This week&#39;s 3:35pm recitation will be held in Hanes 130 this Friday, not in the usual room in Sitterson, due to an event that afternoon.      This does not affect the 1:25pm recitation- that one is in the same place.      I look forward to seeing everyone in class on Thursday as well- I will be doing a quick lecture on assertions, reviewing/answering any questions about material covered thus far, and the rest of the time will be spent finishing the praxis and/or working on the assignments.      Kind regards,   Semion &#34;The operation put (key, value) checks if key is already associated with a value. If it is, it associates key now with value.

I&#39;ve been stuck on this for too long, and cannot understand how to put this table together. I decided to try doing this with two ArrayList objects, in this case they would be combined in someway as separate columns to create a Table? Any hints or resources to point me in the direction to do this would be appreciated. I&#39;ve pretty much read all the class material provided and am stuck on this.

I&#39;ve attached a screenshot of the console output for reference.      Thanks for the help!  Class,      A9 local checks have been challenging, especially as I have tried to do them in a hurry.      I have posted them. Make sure your factory methods are correct.      For those of you who did not do the PaintListeners property, do not worry if you get a 0 in the existing paint listener test. We will check them manually.      No one will get full credit for the new paint listener test, because of some threading issues. You should get 30%.      To see if you are correct, look at the console output, If you see a message in capital saying paint event received,you are fine.      I am hoping I can have something that tests your controller in a few hours after some meetings      Prasun  For the static methods you want us to implement, what use will they serve? I have a couple of &#34;register&#34; methods that take a composite shape as a parameter and breaks it down into its respective atomic properties and adds the listener. I feel they are doing the same? For example my register method takes an avatar type and one of the lines inside it will be myAvatar.getArms().getLeftLine().addPropertyChangeListener(this); in the AnInheritingBridgeScenePainter class?     The Assignment PDF does NOT specify that we should ONLY include ONE method in PaintListener, paint.      I made one other method, and I get:      ### gradingTools.comp401f16.assignment9.testcases.observablepainter.NewPaintListenerTestCase: 1.0   Adding paint listener to observable bridge scene painter\\xa0   java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException    at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)    at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:62)    at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43)   ...

scene? Given that there are 5 avatars each with their own text as well as a bridge, there are a lot of pieces to access.      Or to clarify this question, are we just observing the texts and the bridge?    How can we get object editor to pause between each action?(To show more of an animation without hitting refresh) I just get the end result of what the demo does. What should a boolean readonly property in A6 look like? An if/else statement in the property that returns True or False?  Also, how should the message text be changed for the Avatars in the RunTests? For example the RunTest wants the Avatar guard to say &#34;Quest?&#34; What is the correct way to go about doing this? Hi students,      I need to move my office hours on Wednesday 10/26 to Friday after each recitation (2:15pm and 4:25 pm).      (Your A6 will actually be graded on Thursday)      The recitation on Friday will go over creating custom views and MVC pattern. In the mean time feel free to e-mail me any questions or concerns.      Andrew    Will there be local checks for hw8 before the early submission time?    The HW8 Checkstyle gives the same false errors from previous assignments.

Old Value == New Value in some property notification. %0.85### gradingTools.comp401f16.assignment8.testcases.ConsoleSceneViewOutputTestCase: 0.85   \\xa0   Above is copied from the last part of the console log.      Hi I&#39;m debugging the assignment, and it says:   property: mp.ComponentClasses.GraphObjects.Atomic.AMovingString&#64;c25fedcnew value 510 == old value 510   but in the log, the two notifications of AMovingString both change the value of the property.      Why is that?    On question 12, the question asks which of the following contains the state.    in BMIMVCComposer, when questions talk about a &#34;connection&#34; between the model and another structure, a reference is a connection.  Just in case you guys have this issue, local checks shows my ConsoleSceneViewOutputTestCase[50.0 pts] is\\xa0wrong though the old/new values are correctly changed. Professor Dewan suggests not to print irrelevant words in your AConsoleView class (in my case is &#34;Property Change Event:&#34;) but just println the event itself. My problem is solved in this way. The previous error message is attached below.            ObjectEditor(Version 22, built on Wed Oct 26 15:41:27 EDT 2016). Copyright Prasun Dewan, 2012, All rights reserved. US Patent Appl.

I&#39;m getting an error in local check that says that I do not have 7 property notifications and I&#39;m pretty sure I do.\\xa0 I was wondering if there is maybe something I am not seeing.

I didn&#39;t see the time of the deadline and thought it was open till 11:59 tonight.  Which sections of material does the exam cover? Is it till Inheritance or until the most recent Collection kinds?   EDIT: Will arrays/arraylists/linkedlists be on the exam?  So I&#39;m still having difficulty trying to understand the difference between instance variables and properties. I know that properties don&#39;t necessarily have to have getters and setters, but if that&#39;s so, what defines a property?  Class,      The exam will involve coding and there will be a fixed amount of space for each question. We will be scanning the exam, so it is important you write in the allocated space.      I recommend you bring a dark \\xa0pencil \\xa0and eraser so you do not create multiple copies of your solution. The dark pencil is important from the scanning point of view.      Also bring some scratch paper - normally my exams are not long and you should have enough time to rewrite solutions if you need to.      And remember a good night sleep is normally good for coding success ...      The exam will have multiple related questions that build on each other - you will be able to \\xa0get credit for a question even if you\\xa0could not answer the preceding questions.\\xa0      Good luck ..      Prasun  1. Lets say we have an atomic type, how will the physical or logical structure look like?\\xa0   2. So will the structure have just a single node, with no edges connecting to it?         My attempt to answer it:   1. Since it is atomic, it isn&#39;t decomposable. Logical or physical structure wouldn&#39;t matter here since it doesn&#39;t have any edges connecting to it.   2. The node will just be itself. It will be a root and it won&#39;t have anything connecting to it.      Please let me know if I am wrong.     Hey Everyone,      Just a reminder that there will be tutoring available on Monday from 6-7:15 in SN047. Good time to ask last minute exam questions haha.\\xa0      best,   Sam  Class,      We plan to use Gradescope, which in turn, needs your email.      We can generate your email by adding the suffix live.unc.edu to your onyen.      If this email does not work for you, please send mail to:    help401-002-f16&#64;cs.unc.edu    with the subject:    Non-live\\xa0email address         The message body should include your email address      Prasun    Suppose I have some class implementing some interface and it has a read only property called &#34;This&#34; which returns the interface it implements. In the tree structure is the root the class or the interface? And is there a two way arrow between the two? Anyone know how to set up a 2nd constructor for the Angle Class in A5? What Arguments does it take? That is, so the object arguments can be modified from the Avatar Class.  More specifically: Say I am doing Legs = new Angle(); in the Avatar class, now I want to add arguments to it  Legs = new Angle(x,y,height,width);  How would I get this to work in the Angle Class in a 2nd constructor? I&#39;m having trouble understanding 3a in the Old Exam number 1.   I understand how a table works, and I understand how to write code that can instantiate a Set object, but how would I use the Table and aTable types given?      I&#39;m confused because the Set object we&#39;re writing code for seems more simple than the Table - it has only one list of objects, rather than two lists\\xa0objects associated by indices. What would\\xa0an Add method with only one parameter do to a table?      I would understand how to write code for the Table that uses two Sets, however.      Does the add{Object anElement) method use the parameter as the key, and then add the corresponding value to a list?  Anyone planning to get tutoring today? Fall break technically starts today, so didn&#39;t know if anyone was planning to show up.\\xa0        It has come to our attention that some of you are missing the part the of the feedback file where shows you the number of points by feature that you earned. If that is the case for you, please comment below so we know how many people this has happened to.          Are we permitted to reuse this code that&#39;s in the praxis and recitation material or do we have to build our own take on it from scratch?  I can&#39;t feed a quote token into the say method. Do you want us to convert it back to a string? If so, which way would be preferable?         I found out the solution.   ****DISREGARD***\\xa0  When initializing the table in the Command Interpreter, do you we make new Avatar instances or just get them? I tried calling their getters (getArthur(), getGalahad(), etc.) and it gave me NullPointerExceptions.  So this table is supposed to take any arbitrary object associated with a key, right? I&#39;m not supposed to make it a table specifically *for* Avatars or\\xa0come up with a constructor\\xa0that can be initialized to accept only certain types of objects (in this case, Avatars), correct?  The warning I get when rotating a line is   W***Received notification(s) for unknown (possibly invisible or unrecognized atomic-shape) property: Angle of object: grail.scene.Line&#64;4d9ac0b4. Ignoring notification.      Assignment8 works and the line rotates without needing a refresh but for some reason calling the rotate method brings up this warning. And I dont know how to fix it  I got minus five points for Assignment Five due to an &#34;Interactive Run&#34;, does anyone know what this is exactly referring to?    What&#39;s the exact annotation we should use for a map pattern? Simply using &#34;MapPattern&#34; gives an error.  Average is 122/135.      Common mistakes:   Not using correct property name for the array. You should&#39;ve had a method like this in your bean:   public Token[] getTokens() {...}   Not clearing the previous array after setting a new scannedString value.   Your working program should just like\\xa0this:        Do we need an interface for this class given that all of the methods are static? The interface gives compiler errors whenever we use static declarations.      Furthermore, should we define the objects this class creates as properties under property names and make this class a bean pattern?  In the assignment document, it says that methods from superclasses must not be duplicated in subclasses. \\xa0Is it okay to override methods though? \\xa0For instance, my ARotatingLine class extends ABoundedShape (because it has X, Y, Height, Width), but it is necessary for the setHeight and setWidth methods to be overridden because they need to update the Radius and Angle properties. \\xa0This doesn&#39;t count as duplicating methods does it?    Is there an answer key we can use to see if we answered the questions from the practice exam correctly? Also are there any additional resources(such as even older exams) that we could use to help prepare for next week&#39;s exam?\\xa0  In implementing the Table for Assignment 7, I am using StructurePatternNames.MAP_PATTERN as the structure pattern for my Table class, but OE gives me an error saying:      E***Class:main.ATable does not follow declared pattern: Hashmap Pattern. Ignoring pattern declaration. W***Assuming implicit pattern: Hashtable Pattern instead of: Hashmap Pattern      I have defined get and put methods and they seem to be working as expected, and the only other methods I have defined are getters for the Keys ArrayList and Values ArrayList in order to try to use OE to view the table. \\xa0Am I missing some requirement of the MAP_PATTERN?  In A7 is says to show the scanner, bridge scene and Command Interpreter in OE windows. I can show the scanner and bridge scene just fine but the command interpreter gives me a stack overflow error and then the bottom error over and over again   ObjectEditor(Version 22, built on Wed Sep 07 12:53:46 EDT 2016).

Am I not even supposed to be doing that? Or is there just something else wrong  I put the getters of Width and Height in one interface I1, and put the setters of width and height in another interface, I2 that extends I1, which one should I tag BoundedShape?  Can I use generics on Table? Something like MapTable&lt;S,T&gt;.   And in SingletonsCreator, it&#39;s constructed as MapTable&lt;String,Object&gt;;   And can I just make it as MapTable&lt;String,Avatar&gt; when it&#39;s being constructed in SingletonsCreator?      Also, there&#39;s another form of table in assignment 11, a table that maps String to Command objects, used in define, call and thread.\\xa0   Are the two tables the same table? Or are they two tables?   I thought they were two tables and that&#39;s one reason I used generics to implement the table.  Package:\\xa0\\xa0lectures.mvc.properties.atomic   Quiz:MVC Atomic Properties  Class,      1. A couple of you, because of medical issues, could not do the praxes and quizzes within the required time. Also some of you could not submit your completed quizzes because of misunderstanding of the completion time. So I just opened all quizzes until 11 am Thursday. Please complete by then.      2. On Thu I plan to go over the quiz questions that many got wrong. I believe Sakai has a feature that lets me find these questions. More important, please mark those on which you need more elaboration. This will serve as a &#34;revision&#34; before the midterm. T      3. The midterm will cover everything we have done until today. It will cover inheritance but not MVC.      4. I have a practice exam - look at it after you have studied to see how well you have done so, rather than before, as I will not be asking those exact questions and your preparation should not be influenced by the specific questions I ask.      5. As I will not ask these questions, there is no key, which often dissuades students from trying to solve the problems on their own.      6.\\xa0The course keeps evolving, so I do\\xa0not publish exams more than a year old. Also I sometimes involuntarily/voluntarily end up asking questions I have asked before, and I do not want to look at more than one exam to see if I am repeating a question.      7. You are responsible for the material covered through the praxes, quizzes, and my in-class lectures. Anything outside that, which may be in the videos or Word documents, is not something I will test you on.  You should NOT create a new instance of Table for Command Interpretter. Rather, use your factory method class to create this instance and then have the command interpreter utilize that instance. This prevents multiple avatar tables from exisiting which reference different avatars.    Are nested if/else explicitly banned if we&#39;re doing the extra credit portion?    &#34;To demonstrate your work, write a main class that creates instances of the ScannerBean, BridgeScene, and CommandInterpreter classes and asks ObjectEditor to display all three objects. Then, as in assignment 4, animate the result of entering different strings. &#34;      Should we just demo the move and say strings? or should we demo every possible of token we have?    &#34;The command interpreter should recognize the following three commands, and invoke the corresponding methods in the scene. The syntax of these commands syntax is abstractly defined by the following grammar:  \\uf0e0  |   \\uf0e0 say-token quoted-string-token  \\uf0e0 move-token word-token number-token number-token&#34;      Before the Command Interpretter can parse through, does there have to be a word that prefaces it called &#34;Command&#34;? In this case would an invalid command be anything that isn&#39;t Say or Move?\\xa0      &#34;Detect invalid commands entered by the user. On encountering the first unexpected token or the end of input, abandon interpretation of the command and report the error by indicating the unexpected token/end of input you received and the correct token you expected in its stead. You should display this error message by setting a string readonly property, called Errors, of the command interpreter. If you support this feature, put an extra tag in the command interpreter: “ErrorResilientCommandInterpreter”.      What do we define as the &#34;unexpected end&#34; of input? The Command word followed by nothing?     Class,      1. Some of you require an ending space in your scanned string and some of you require there be no ending space. The assignments required you to support an ending space, but we have been testing with both kinds of strings. In A7 it will become hard to know if an error is due to the presence/absence of space or other factors. So the tests will have an ending space. If you can not handle that, just check if the string ends with a space, and iff it does, scan, not the original string, but a substring without the last character.      2. If you get factory methods wrong, we will not be able to test your command interpreter. To test it, we need to set a property in the command interpreter and then see its effect on the bridge scene and without factory methods we cannot get access to the bridge scene\\xa0- it is not a property of the command interpreter. So look carefully at the instructions and ask if you do not understand, You should be instantiating the singleton classes only in the singletons creator, not in the bridge scene or command interpreter and other classes. And if we call the same factory method twice, you should return the same object.      Prasun        In the visitor pattern, the visitor interface behaves so much like functional interface.   If we can just use functional interface, we can avoid creating new classes every time we want a different visitor method. I think it&#39;s pretty convenient and interesting. Can we actually do that?      P.S. Just a little complaint, it&#39;s so bad that Java doesn&#39;t really support Lambda expressions. Functional interface does so much less than Lambda expression... But anyway Java is pure OOP...    Will Local Checks be available before the early submission time?  Are on the web, please let me know of problems as usual  Are the properties for Locatable and BoundedShape editable?\\xa0   Might be some ambiguity in my question, what I am asking if the Locatable and BoundedShape will have setters that can be passed down to their subclasses?  I have my table working.\\xa0 I was wondering where we should &#34;fill&#34; the table with the avatars and keys?\\xa0 Inside of the constructor for the CommandInterpreter class?      Also, should the methods (put &amp; get) inside of the table be static?  Hi,      Those of you who submitted Assignment 4 about a week late- after Monday of the following week (9/26) but by Friday of the following week (9/30) may have received a 5% greater deduction in points than we had said you would. If this is the case, come speak to Andrew so we can fix that.      This does not apply to anyone who submitted it earlier or later than that period.      Thanks,   Semion  Expression e of type E can be assigned to variable v of type V if E IS-A V      In this statement, an expression is any piece of code that yields a value such as :   5   5 &#43; 2   new ArrayList();   (new ArrayList()).size();     I&#39;m trying to set up my table but I wanted to make sure that I understand how its put method works      Is the following an accurate interpretation?      Let   key and value be the already-defined parameters keys be the name of the ArrayList that contains all key elements vals be the name of the ArrayList that contains all value elements      If  the element key exists in keys at index position i, and the element at index i of vals contains some element  Then the element at index i of vals is to be replaced by value      and      If the element key does not exist in keys Then key is added to the next available position in keys at index j and value is added to the index jth position in vals  Are we allowed to use the get(index) method that comes with ArrayList?  I just started my assignment 7 and I missed the last class because of a workshop, so my question may look stupid. What&#39;s the usage of locatable? In the ALocatable class in the package lectures.inheritance.is_a, the setters of x and y are empty and the getters return 0. What&#39;s the purpose of doing this? Thanks!  I have read the pdf and the slides, watched the video and practiced a little bit myself, on the subject of thread and etc. But I&#39;m still confused on a particular question.      Why is Thread.sleep() a static method?      The question rises when I try to implement a OE-independent SleepCommand class, by calling Thread.currentThread().sleep(m_sleepTime) instead of using OE ThreadSupport. However this approach failed since sleep() is a static method, and thus I cannot use m_sleepTime, a instance variable, as a parameter.      How can I fix this problem?  When I run my program I get the CommandInterpreter window to appear, but there is no field to type into.\\xa0 I have to click on a button at the top labeled &#34;CommandInterpreter&#34; next to the button &#34;Common&#34; and select &#34;SetCommand(String)&#34;.\\xa0 When I click on the SetCommand(String) option it opens up another window where it does allow me to enter text.\\xa0 I was wondering what I am doing wrong as I think you are supposed to just type into the first Object Editor window that comes up?    ScreenShot.jpg     Is it possible to make the quiz on MVC due for after fall break? It&#39;s a bit hectic to try to really understand this concept and its intricacies(and thus do well on the quiz) while trying to prepare for our exam.  For the occupied boolean property, where do we put the tag? Before the getter or before the\\xa0variable declaration?  Average: 125/140      Most common problem again is not using correct tag/property/class names.    Are we permitted to post our answers to the practice exam and discuss?  Class,      I received two requests to open that\\xa0two quizzes that were due yesterday\\xa0- the excuse was that there was already an assignment due and the students did not see the date.      This is not really a good excuse, after the fact, as the students who finished in time are at a disadvantage. I opened the quizzes last week for students with medical reasons, which is a good reason, and advertised it so that people who happened to notice the open quizzes do not have an advantage.      Nonetheless, I have opened the two quizzes for late submission. Those who have already submitted get a second chance to improve their grade, so hopefully this is fair to everyone.      Also the MVC quiz deadline is postponed by a week as requested      Prasun       For A5 assuming I am creating all the images. The proper way to set it up is to create a new object for each image and then a new getImage for each image? Unless there is a more convenient way to do this I am just checking. This would I guess also be the way to create multiple lines, string classes etc.   In our approach method, do we have the knight &#34;march&#34; like they do in the video or can we just move them to the knight area? Also is this method apart of our bridgescene or should it be apart of main?    Average: 166   Total without EC: 185      Common Mistakes:   -Not having a single parameter constructor   -Printing &lt;Token&gt; instead of the actual token object   -Improper tagging and naming of classes/properties   -If you create a package, it must be under grail or mp or it will be seen as an illegal import          According to the feedback file I had lost points for not having screenshots but I had uploaded a zip folder alongside my assignment(named Assignment 3 Screenshots to clear confusion) as there was more than one screenshot. Was this an error in the grader?    If this class is to implement only one interface and is supposed to be extended by all of the token classes, will this only apply to our WordToken class and all subsequent subclasses? Otherwise our Number token classes will require a String property for &#34;Value&#34; in place of the traditional int and token classes such as QuoteString will need to have Value properties where they previously did not.      Finally, should the classes that use inherieteance also implement the common \\xa0interface?  Class,      A6 checks are on the web with the usual caveats. For those who did extra credit in A4, please check A4 checks also and let us know of any problems with the checks.      Prasun  Hello Everyone,      Just a reminder there will be tutoring available today and Wednesday in SN 047 from 6-7ish. Someone replied so tutoring will be 6-7ish both these days.      best,   Samuel     For the say method, it is necessary that we know which knight is in the area (i.e. which knight whose utterance we need to change). \\xa0We could figure this out by checking x and y coordinates of all of the knights each time &#39;say&#39; is run (or at least each time it is run and KnightTurn = true) or we could define an additional property KnightInArea (or something like that) which tracks which knight (if any) is in the knight standing area. \\xa0Are we allowed to define such a property?  I am wondering where I should put all the animation code.\\xa0 Should we animate the avatars inside of the constructor of the BridgeScene class?\\xa0 Or should it be done in the main class?\\xa0      Right now in my constructor for the BridgeScene I set all the avatars to their beginning positions, create the gorge image and the shapes for the knights and guard to stand in.      Should all of the &#34;say&#34; commands and &#34;approach&#34; be written inside the main method?\\xa0  I am still uncertain if I am structuring my Avatar class correctly; I have a constructor which takes the head image shape as its argument, and I initialize it, along with the other body parts (arms, legs, torso, and the string shape). Then in BridgeScene, I initialize the avatar for all five characters, and have getters for each of them (all per specs). Then after this is where I&#39;m unsure between a few different next steps: am I supposed to use setters for different parts of each body part to set their x and y values to connect them inside of the character getters in BridgeScene, or some other way?\\xa0  Class,      The packages are:      lectures.inheritance.is_a;   lectures.arrays.collections_kinds;      The quizzes are:   Inheritance &#34;IS-A&#34;   Kinds of Collections         You should do them in the order given. They are relatively short, so you should be able to catch up this week.      Prasun  Class,      In response to some of the Piazza comments, I have made some edits:      1. I have taken Matt&#39;s suggestion and put in an extra iproperty to return the interacting Knight. You are not required to have it, as I am suggesting this late.      2. I have clarified that if you do animations (for fun) the code is in the avatar but called from main.      Prasun    &#34;To put some structure in this part of your assignment: implement a class tagged “Token” that implements the common interface, and make all of the other token classes direct or indirect subclasses of this class. Thus, the new super class has the same tag as the common interface. Similarly, the command token classes will be subclasses of the word class and will simply define a constructor that calls the superclass constructor.&#34;      Does this mean all of our subclasses of token and word should have the &#34;Token&#34; tag?  In VectorArrayListUser you will not be able to step into the add() function unless you have the JDK. \\xa0I&#39;ve attached a couple of screenshots showing what happens when you do this. \\xa0First you step into Integer.class, then return, then step into ArrayList.class.      Since we are marking this property&#39;s visibility as false, should we still include it under property names?  Checks for A4 was wrongly taking points out for\\xa0the quote array test.      Checks for A6 was printing mistakes but the credit was incorrectly given.      The new jar addresses these two issues.      Make sure you refresh the project after copying the new jar    Are we required to do these parts of the assignment if it&#39;s not explicitlly said that we should complete them? For example a5 had explicit instructions to have our avatars march as part of our demo while a6 doesn&#39;t say anything about these additional features in our demo.  I am getting this error:      W***Implicitly editable property: inputof class class main.ScannerBean not considered editable as it is not in editable property names list.         I have nothing called &#34; inputof &#34; in my program.\\xa0 I was wondering how this error message in the console can be fixed.     I named my Avatar&#39;s stringshape property &#34;StringShape&#34; instead of &#34;Text&#34; as Assignment 5 made no explicit instruction to do so. Will I lose points for this/ Is it worth resubmitting late over?    Checkstyle is giving me an error that my bridgescene class is missing a setText() call. However, this call is made in my &#34;say&#34; method.      Furthermore, it appears that I got 0 points in the local checks for the scroll function although my demo shows that it visually works. I believe this is due to the fact that local checks uses the positioning of the arms to be the location of the avatar. If we used the upper left corner of the head as the location and simply moved the arms and body in context to how the Head moves, will we still get extra credit?  It&#39;s required that every class implement one single interface.   Does this mean a subclass can only implement interfaces that are either implemented by its super class(es), or extend the interface(s) that are implemented by its super class(es)?  When I do the EC part of the ClearableHistory, I assigned each token to both the token array and the clearable history. My object editor looks fine, but the console gives me some errors saying something like\\xa0 &#34;  E***Object:grail.Tokens.Word&#64;58594a11 displayed multiple times with following references:     \\xa0[AScannerBean.tokens.8, AScannerBean.tokenList.8]  &#34;.\\xa0 I guess this is because each token is stored twice. Is this error fine? For your reference, the following two images are screenshots of my object editor and the console. Thanks!                   Class,      Today we will have a lecture on inheritance and collections - I expect it to take most if not all of the class time.      Which means you will have many opportunities to answer questions.      The last time I looked a little less than half of the class has filled in the class discussion quiz.      Let me emphasize again why class participation is important.      In exams, grading constrains the kind of questions that can be asked - it is difficult yo get good answers for and grade discussion/essay/conceptual/definition questions. However, ultimately, what you learn here has to be named and defined, especially if someone asks you what you learned in an interview.      It is for this reason that your grade depends on class discussion.      To put things in perspective, each assignment is about 3% (35 percent for twelve assignments). Class discussion is going to have at least a 3% weight\\xa0- it is part of the 15% I allocated for classwork (praxes, recitation, class discussion). I left it fluid because I wanted to see how much discussion actually happens. \\xa0But 3% is the minimum I will allocate for it, and how much you get will depend not only on if you ever answered a question but also how many times you did so and what kind of answer you gave, which is why documenting what you did is important. I know there is stage fright, but a question such as &#34;what did you learn&#34; surely is easy to answer and get some practice overcoming this fright!      I keep repeating this stuff in the hope it will make a difference ...         Prasun  For moving a knight into the standing area, how would you create a method that lets you pick and choose which knight you wish to move in object editor? Currently, my method for moving the avatar into the standing area keeps erroring and forcing me to create a completely new avatar in the object editor window when I try to use the method through OE interface. I cannot choose from avatars already made.     I&#39;m making the approach scene question and I&#39;m having trouble. if the knights are in different areas (left side of the bridge), am I suppose to come up with with general animation code (move method) that&#39;ll move it to the knight area? I feel that won&#39;t work since the knights are in different locations.  It might be a little bit early to ask this question.   But can I make the return type of ParseNumber Integer instead of int?   This way it can return null and is more suitable for dealing with errors.  If I didn&#39;t get it wrong, there seems to be a little typo in HW11 EC &#34;More Recursive Descent Parsing&#34;:      in the grammar of RotateLeftArm/RotateRightArm (grammar 10/11), a word-token (representing the name of the avatar whose arm is to be rotated) seems to be missing.  Are tags alone sufficient for interfaces? It seems like we have only been asked to include structurepatterns, propertynames, and editablepropertynames in classes and not interfaces. Are these other annotations appropriate in interfaces as well?  So in your assignment you say &#34;implement a class tagged &#34;Token&#34; that implements the common interface, and make all the other token classes direct or indirect subclasses of this class&#34; Which is saying that you need to put &#64;Tags({&#34;Token&#34;}) in the Token superclass. \\xa0Then it says &#34;Thus the new super class has the same tag as the common interface&#34;. Which is saying the super class now has the same tag the common interface has. The common interface has\\xa0&#64;Tags({&#34;Word&#34;, &#34;Number&#34;, &#34;Plus&#34;, etc.}). What &#64;Tag({}) do we put in the superclass then?      CommonInterface.java   &#64;Tags({&#34;Word&#34;, &#34;Number&#34;, &#34;Plus&#34;, etc.})      TokenSuperclass.java   &#64;Tag({&#34;&#34;}) \\xa0&lt;----?  I&#39;m doing HW8 right now and took a brief look at further homeworks;   in HW 8 and other future relevant homeworks, we no longer have to notify the Observer on the change of &#34;Occupied&#34; and &#34;KnightTurn&#34;, and in particular &#34;InteractingKnight&#34;, right?      (Since Occupied and KnightTurn not really need be displayed, and InteractingKnight is already been observed as one of the knight or guard. Is this correct?)  Hey Everyone,      I am going on vacation Monday so I will be moving office hours to Wednesday from 6-7:30 in SN047 and Thursday same times. Moving back in the week also makes sense to give you time to ask questions about the exam. If you have been studying for the exam on the 18th and have any conceptual questions this would be a great time to ask.\\xa0      best,   Sam        In the EC alternative part, are we still painting the entire scene in one JFrame, using one single ObservableBridgeScenePainter, but with 5 different view objects?   If the answer is yes, I don&#39;t see why the order of view objects registering to the painter affects the order of drawing, since the repaint() method will always be called and the entire scene is actually repainted no matter what changes.          If the user types the letter ‘o’ then all avatars should return to their original positions.\\xa0   What does &#34;original position&#34; stands for? The position before last move? Or the position when the controller was constructed?        For our Avatar composite shape, should our String property be\\xa0 called  &#34;StringShape&#34; or be of type &#34;StringShape&#34;?    ObjectEditor asks me to define the getters of my two rotating line shapes that make up my angle shape and thus won&#39;t display. However, I&#39;ve defined the getter and I&#39;ve labeled it properly in the PropertyNames section. Any reason why OE won&#39;t recognize this?  Class,      We will do inheritance and collections in an integrated manner - so this will be looong,\\xa0taking both days of the week.      Sakai Quiz: Inheritance and Collections   JavaTeaching Package:lectures.inheritance      The material is complicated but essential to understanding how to program in object-oriented languages.      Prasun  Is it ok if we don&#39;t define a constructor for the bridgescene class that does not take arguments? That is, we only define one constructor that takes arguements for each avatar?  Average: 91/120      Common mistakes:       -Not using correct property names!!!    I see many people making this mistake. It&#39;s important to use the exact property name we give you. So in this assignment we asked you to &#34;create an editable scannedstring property&#34;. This directly translates to two methods:      public String getScannedString() {...}   public void setScannedString(String myString) {...}      and these tags:      &#64;PropertyNames({&#34;ScannedString&#34;})   &#64;EditablePropertyNames({&#34;ScannedString&#34;}).      -Not submitting screenshots of you playing with the debug mode.    -Incorrect program structure. Your main class should always be called AssignmentN (uppercase &#39;A&#39;) where N is the assignment number. It should be in a package called &#34;main&#34; (lowercase).    -Your other classes should be tagged. In that case it doesn&#39;t matter what the class name is.     How is extra credit calculated into the total grade?   So sakai grade book has assignments 35%, fudge 10%;   does this mean the total score in assignments cannot exceed the full score, and the part (caused by ec) exceeding the full score is counted in the fudge part?   My words might be a little bit unorganised but I&#39;m just curious how the extra credits are calculated.  Class,      They are on the web with the usual caveats.      Scaling the head gets you more extra credit though you get extra credit even if you do not scale it.      I noticed that some of your displays are really small on Windows machines. You can invoke the following code to scale your ObjectEditor display:      ObjectEditor.setDenseMagnification(3.0);  Assignment5Suite.main(args);      Prasun  As far as I&#39;m concerned, there are multiple ways to scale some image-like or picture-like thing in Java.   Is there a preference on the choice? And can we use other classes other than ImageIcon to do the job?  Class,   If you have lost points in assignments, make sure:      1. You understand the exact reason for it, by posting on Piazza (preferable) or talking to us, as the error messages can be cryptic.\\xa0      2. You do not lose multiple times for the same mistake, in different assignments. You will have to keep track of this, and report the problem to the TA who graded your assignment.      Prasun        Class,      I think I have said this before, but it is important to reiterate this given how many of you are making mistakes CheckStyle would have caught. (Remember localchecks\\xa0do not use CheckStyle output, but our final checks do.)      Some checks are done automatically when the file is saved.      Others are done by explicitly selecting the project and executing Check Code with CheckStyle.      Most of the checks I have written are executed explicitly.      Activating checkstyle\\xa0does not achieve the same effect      Prasun        What are the steps of importing an image found online or saved in the computer into the code again? I can&#39;t seem to figure out how to do so. Also, is it required for all the components to be used, or are we allowed to use one or two of the shapes?  In the Inheritance praxis, in the class AnInheritingStringDatabase, there is a typo in one of the question, with it reading\\xa0   If interface I extends interface J, and class C implements I, then A must * implement the methods: * (a) declared only in I. * (b) declared only in J. * (c) declared in I and J.   while it should read   If interface I extends interface J, and class C implements I, then C must * implement the methods: * (a) declared only in I. * (b) declared only in J. * (c) declared in I and J.  In local checks 5, there is a somewhat misleading error message. When the suite gives out 0 points and says that the error is &#34;NullPointerException,&#34; it is very likely that the cause is a missing &#64;Tag in the interface and implementation classes, and not lack of initialization. Hope this helps.  If eclipse gives you an error when you use ObjectEditor.setDenseMagnification(3.0); in the local check, remove oeall22.jar should fix it.  Class,      As some of you pointed out today, the course syllabus (which was submitted before classes started)\\xa0says:\\xa0 Submitting it on the Wednesday of that week will result in a 5% extra credit. Submitting it on the Monday (Friday) of the next week will result in a penalty of 5% (15%).\\xa0      However, the pdf of the PPT I showed seems to say, 5% and 10%. What I intended to say was that an extra 10 percent is lost by going to Friday. A student and I tried to listen to the actual words I said, the voice level was low, and we could not hear the word extra.      Those who discovered this discrepancy should have pointed this our earlier - it is too late to regrade A2 and A1 (no one complained the late penalty on A1). But for A3 and A4 we will make it 10%.\\xa0      As I mentioned in class, we wil\\xa0give you until Friday night (tomorrow) for A3 late submission. If you do so, you will lose only 15% instead of 20% and you will get manual grading of the assignment.\\xa0      As I mentioned in an earlier post, the A3 checks will lighting up green even if you had mistakes - you needed to look at the log. I will try and fix the checks and post a new version as soon I get some time, before tonight hopefully.      Prasun           Hi Professor, I forgot to remove the classes I created to run the checkstyle from my main package for assignment 3 and 4. Will this cause losing points?\\xa0     I just uploaded a new local checks\\xa0jar that should catch more errors\\xa0      A3 is worth 200 points, btw ...  As per previous assignments, do you still want us to place the annotations on classes that weren&#39;t necessarily specified? So for example:      Bridge Scene Class:   &#64;StructurePattern(&#34;Bean Pattern&#34;)   &#64;Tags ({&#34;BridgeScene&#34;})   &#64;PropertyNames({&#34;Arthur&#34;,&#34;Lancelot&#34;, &#34;Robin&#34;, &#34;Galahad&#34;, &#34;Guard&#34;})      Bridge Scene Interface:   &#64;Tags\\xa0({&#34;BridgeScene&#34;})  Hi Professor, currently I set the height and width of the hands and legs to be same to the head. In this way, when I scale the avatar, I only need to scale the head. The other body parts are proportional to that. Is this OK?  Class,      See my interaction with Conrad on why the number tests in A3 may alternate between passing and failing:\\xa0 https://piazza.com/class/iqv0bsb3p2i3ch?cid=158       I have updated the local checks jar to change the student input data (we have been focussing on grader input data) so you should no longer get this alternating behavior.      Also I have cleaned up the output to make tracing easier. The message you get with incorrect output identifies which pattern was not matched, as does the console \\xa0output.      The A5 missing tag message should be better.      I was told that in A4, if your program expects no ending space, you get no credit at least for the quote case. I have made a change that affects all cases - let me know if there is a problem.      Ignore the locatable test in A4, I am in the middle of adding rotating line to A4.      Prasun  I&#39;m having an error when running the Local Checks.\\xa0 I get the full points awarded after I click on the part that is missing points.\\xa0 I have included a video of the error.       https://vid.me/AoqR      We were looking at a student&#39;s\\xa0A3 and in their\\xa0Common interface they\\xa0had multiple &#64;Tags({}) lines. This MUST\\xa0be combined\\xa0like this: &#64;Tags({“one”,”two”,”three”}) or it makes our life difficult.      It should NOT be like this:   &#64;Tags({&#34;one&#34;})   &#64;Tags({&#34;two&#34;})   &#64;Tags({&#34;three&#34;})      Note: if your code compiles (no red underlines), you can disregard this.\\xa0      So if you did this on A3 or after, resubmit today.  Make sure if you use a for loop (to make the avatar move nicely) in your main method to demo your Assignment 5 don&#39;t let the pixels being added exceed the width and height of the ObjectEditor window. It will throw errors.\\xa0         - Just trying to help out!  Just FYI, screenshots must be outside your zip folder for us to see them. So alongside your zip folder on sakai. This is only 10/200 points so it&#39;s not a big deal, but just for the future.      So you should only submit one ZIP or we may not find your project.        If we submit Assignment 4 after today but before it&#39;s graded, will our assignment be graded manually or automatically?\\xa0    I get this error whenever I run my main method. It does the movement of the avatars correctly and even after the error shows, it still keeps moving the avatars. The treepanel shows weird output as well. It starts to hide the values. I tried googling it and I couldn&#39;t find anything.

However, I can&#39;t seem to find where the assignment says that our Line class&#39; implementation must include a getX()/getY() method?

In the part of refactoring token code, is only required for  Token classes  to implement one single interface (for each class), or it&#39;s required for  all classes , including Gorge,Avatar,Angle,etc.   P.S. I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s only meant for Token classes, and the wording is quite clear in the PDF, but I just want to make sure.   The reason I&#39;m asking this question is:   first, since Java provides the functionality of implementing multiple interfaces, why don&#39;t we make use of it;   second, for classes that represent certain graph object, like Gorge, Angle, etc, it&#39;s really convenient to implement multiple interfaces, in particular, Gorge;   third, if I have to make certain classes only implement one interface, I have to actually create interfaces that extend some other interfaces but have nothing else itself, which seems to me not efficient.   Thank you.  Sakai is not allowing me to submit the recitation 5 assignment late? is it possible to change this?  One of the reasons for the delayed grading of Hw1 (which is being regraded as we speak) is that a small minority of you has not paid heed to:\\xa0    \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Be sure to follow the conventions for the name and package of the main class.       The conventions are that the main class for AssignmentN is in the package  main  and \\xa0named  AssignmentN .      We could give you a zero for all tests that depend on this, and in A1 all do. This would mirror what happens in the real world when you do not follow instructions and many of my colleagues in this university and others have told me that this is a lesson worth learning. The cost to us of manually recovering from this mistake is very high. We have to unzip your code, change the names, and all of its references.      However, we feel it is a pity if we penalize you so heavily, at least for the first assignment.      For now, please reply to this message immediately if you have not followed the guidelines, telling us the name of your main class in each assignment \\xa0you have already submitted if it has deviated from what is expected. We may be able to change our code to look for those. Do not send us email.      In future, the only recourse you will have is to resubmit it late and lose 20% credit.      If you are the kind who has trouble\\xa0remembering what are admittedly \\xa0trivial but important details, then you should run local runtime checks and also run checkstyle. There is really no excuse for such mistakes given the resources at your disposal.              Class,      I strongly recommend you read the discussion\\xa0 Runtime checks throwing errors \\xa0to see if your A3 solution works.      As that discussion shows, the bean tests can give full points even if you have mistakes. So look at the console to see if\\xa0anything is amiss; my responses explain the messages you might see,      In general the runtime checks are incomplete and may give false positives and negatives as I have mentioned several times.      Prasun    My code simply uses the setScannedString method(as this is what does the scanning as per A2 instructions) in the main class. Is it worth going back and incorporating a constructor for this class that sets the input using the constructor and losing points? (And EC for turning in early)  I&#39;m getting an error message &#34;StructurePattern cannot be resolved to a type&#34; that points to the tag we&#39;re supposed to put at the top of the Scanner Bean Class:\\xa0   &#64;StructurePattern(StructurePatternNames.BEAN_PATTERN)      My code was working before I tried to put the tags in. Has anyone else had this problem?    My original returned assignment had 131/116 for the extra credit but it appears to have been removed now. Is this an error with Sakai?  How are we supposed to call the object editor in Assignment 4?\\xa0 Should it be inside of its own class with a main method?     Hello Everyone,      I have had a conflict arise so I will not be able to hold tutoring today (Monday 9-19) at the usual times. Most people have been coming on Wednesday anyway, so hopefully you can come then. Feel free to email me if you have questions.\\xa0      Again Wednesday will be the normal times.\\xa0      best,   Sam     The document for Assignment 4 suggests we use String equals() or equalsIgnoreCase() methods. \\xa0Are we required to explicitly use these, or would something like a switch/case statement be okay? \\xa0i.e.:      switch (token.toLowercase()) {   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0case &#34;move&#34;: \\xa0...   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0case &#34;say&#34;: ...   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0.   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0.   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0.   }      Also, if we are doing the extra credit, should we check word tokens for &#34;rotaterightarm&#34;, &#34;define&#34;, etc.?  For Assignment 4, should our main method directly animate the scanner and then the line, or is it okay if we write and call methods (i.e. animatingScanner() and animatingLine()) which do that?  Class,      Please review the material on properties in case you are still confused about the difference between properties and instance variables. A property can be defined completely independently of instance variables, it is not an instance variable with a getter and setter as many think. A stored property is indeed that.      This is one of the most important praxis you will do and will make make your head hurt a bit. The corresponding assignment (A5) may well be the hardest assignment also (relative to what you know at the start of the assignment) and will make you grow in a new dimension.      Package:\\xa0lectures.composite.objects_shapes   Quiz: Composite Objects - Shapes  Class,      I have made some corrections.      Again, you should restart Eclipse after replacing the files.      Also, my checks do not execute automatically when you save a file (lest they bomb). You have to explicitly select project and ask for checking using the right click menu.      Prasun        First, is the local check A1 suite the actual grading tool used to determine the actual grade?   Second, there seems to be a change in the grade. The grading feedback attached to the assignment submission shows a different score from the score on sakai-gradebook. Is there an updated version of the feedback?      And, the extra credit due date is Wednesday but usually the local check is not updated on Wednesday. Should we just take the risk ourselves?  I&#39;m having trouble importing the recitation 4 code . When i run the driver program, i get this red bus. Can anyone tell me how to properly import the code?  2 questions about interpretation of the assignment      1st,   When they say [&gt;  Thus, if the scanned string  contains the word “MoVE”, you would create an instance of the token class tagged  “Move” and not an instance of the class tagged “Word”,    ] am i supposed to send stuff like &#34;BobMoveWow&#34; to the move class?        Will there be a runtime checks update for Assignment 4 before the early submission time?  A beta version has been uploaded with the usual caveats.           There are numerous errors in checkstyles where, for example, it will say that the getter of a property isn&#39;t defined, even though it is clearly there. Should we just ignore these or will this cost us points?  If the compact array is being created in the scanner setter method (not a global or instance variable), how can I make a getter for it since it is not global?  Class.      I just uploaded a new version of local checks that should take care of input with ending space but I did not have a suitable project \\xa0to test it.      Also last night I uploaded a new checkstyle\\xa0jar and A4 checks file that should give no false \\xa0errors. If you have downloaded them since, ignore this message.      Prasun        As defined by the interface of the rotation line, Angle / Radius are clearly not properties, as there are not getters defined for them.   Get error message from ObjectEditor on implicit property, use &#64;Visible(false) in front of getter to fix. No getter, and no use putting before setter. What to do?   Thank you.  1. Are we able to use the Arrays.toString(array) method to print out the arrays?\\xa0      2. The getter method of the Tokens property will return array object code correct? because at least on mine it did. I&#39;m really sure on what other ways you can print out the array similar to the example you gave in the assignment sheet.  Quiz:\\xa0Composite Objects- Trees, DAGs, and Graphs   Package:\\xa0lectures.composite.tree_dag_graph_objects_windows      Should take about 30 minutes  Class,      I have tried to make this point many times, but looking at some A2 assignments, at least some of you have not understood it clearly.      If I say define a property called ScannedString, it is not sufficient or necessary to define a variable called ScannedString.      You can call the variable anything. It is good to, of course, give it the same name as the property, but all variable names start with lowercase. So a good name is : scannedString.      I always start a property name with upper case to distinguish it from a variable.      And you need a variable only for stored properties. SOme properties are not stored.      But you do need a getter and maybe even a setter based on whether the property is editable or not.      If you do not follow these conventions, our grader cannot understand your code, and these conventions are made for code understanding.      So in A2 many of you will be losing a good chunk of the 25 points for the Bean test. We have to hand grade your assignment to give you partial credit for it.      Localchecks\\xa0should have told you about this mistake.      A3, A4 build on this property, so please use local checks before submitting them.      Prasun        Class,       Method tags should be put both in the classes and interfaces that declare them.         So if you\\xa0are doing extra credit, tag the rotate method both in the line interface and class.      This point was not made clearly in A4, so the early submitters will not lose points for this, but the late submitters\\xa0please do pay heed to this rule to reduce the manual grading effort.   A        Prasun  My only import is Editable property names, not sure if that all I need. And what is suppose to go in the parenthesis for each one of the &#64; things. For propertynames should the &#34;input&#34; and &#34;value&#34; be the name of my variables? what about StructurePatter?  I keep getting a negative height. I make my PolarPoint instance and set the X and Y of the point to the height and width. It doesn&#39;t show a line in ObjectEditor. Mainly because the upper-left is (0,0). And with the angle being negative (height), it goes up and out of screen. How can I get it to show correctly?  So if the grade for an assignment is not yet on Sakai, how do we know if an improvement we made was worth the late penalty?      Also, is it possible for a resubmission to lower our grade, or will the highest of the submitted grades be counted?  When I have my Assignment4 class configured to scan a String and print the elements of the compactArray, it works and i receive full credit in the runtime checks. However, when I instantiate an\\xa0OEFrame, the compiler throws the following error:   W***Value: null of Root.Tokens not in range. Exception in thread &#34;main&#34; java.lang.StackOverflowError \\tat bus.uigen.oadapters.ObjectAdapter.getElideComponentWidth(ObjectAdapter.java:2207) \\tat bus.uigen.oadapters.ObjectAdapter.getElideComponentWidth(ObjectAdapter.java:2207)   I have tried to figure out how to address this error, but I am not sure how to interpret it.      Any ideas?  If we are using inheritance and making our command classes extend the word class, does the word class also have to have tags that reflect the command classes that extend it (similar to how an interface has tags of the names of the classes that implement it)?    How exactly are we supposed to separate packages in Assignment 5? I understand the reasoning behind it given the complexity of the project but I do not understand why we need additional packages mp and grail under main or what they&#39;re even supposed to accomplish. Can we simply break down the packages into other divisions? If not which packages fall under main, mp, and grail respectively?  Suppose I am making a class AHeadImage that I want to be able to use as either a scaled\\xa0or unscaled\\xa0image. \\xa0So, you could call either:      AHeadImage newHead = new AHeadImage(&#34;galahad.jpg&#34;, 100, 100, 50, 50) \\xa0   (50x50 image of galahad at (100,100))      AHeadImage newHead = new AHeadImage(&#34;galahad.jpg&#34;, 100, 100)   (unscaled image of galahad at (100,100))      I can see how do do this using Icon.getIconHeight() and Icon.getIconWidth() (like one of the praxes did) in the second constructor. \\xa0Are we allowed to use this import on Assignment 5? \\xa0Is there a different way I\\xa0should do it instead?  &#34;This shape consists of two (possibly rotating/moving) readonly line properties, named LeftLine and RightLine, whose upper left corner is always at the same location, which is also considered the location of the angle.&#34;   ---Quoted from assignment 5 spec      Does the upper left corner in the text above refer to the\\xa0upper left corner of the whole thing?\\xa0   The reason I&#39;m asking is that in the rotation ec of assn4, I made the rotating origin the &#34;upper left corner&#34;, and the width and height can actually be negative. That way it&#39;s easier to program and easier to understand.   So in this assignment, can I still just make the origin of the angle the &#34;upper left corner&#34;, and the width of the left arm is simply negative?    If we had implemented the ability to check for errors in our prior assignment, should we create an instance for these errors based on what type of token they fall into or should we just bypass this and report the error?  Do we just reuse the prior tags from assignment 2 for our interface and class of the scannerbean?  Reminder. Tutoring will be available in SN047 from 6-7:15 Monday and Wednesday.\\xa0     Is AnExtendibleTreeWalker deprecated in Checkstyle 6.5?   This is the error produced when I attempt to use the local checks file:   cannot initialize module unc.tools.checkstyle.AnExtendibleTreeWalker - Unable to instantiate unc.tools.checkstyle.AnExtendibleTreeWalker cannot initialize module unc.tools.checkstyle.AnExtendibleTreeWalker - Unable to instantiate unc.tools.checkstyle.AnExtendibleTreeWalker      The Global Google Checks works fine.

Start and hopefully finish praxis:      Package: lectures.ui\\xa0   Saka Quiz:\\xa0User Interface and Annotations      It took Semion 30 minutes to finish the praxis, and this one is less dense conceptually than the last two praxes!  Will there be a runtime checks update for Assignment 3 before the early submission date tomorrow?  Hello everyone,      As those of you who have been to my office hours know, my office is tiny. It is in fact so small that I have been asked to move the location of my office hours to avoid disrupting the hallway outside.      My office hours will stay the same time, but from now on they will be in:   SN 252 on Tuesday   SN 155 on Friday      This information will be updated on the class website soon.      Sorry for the inconvenience, but I&#39;m happy you guys are coming to office hours!      Kind regards,   Semion  Class,      I heard from a student yesterday that &#34;my program &#34;works&#34;, do I need interfaces?&#34;   yes your input/output behavior can work without interfaces, instances, named constants etc, but your program does not necessarily meet the style constraints.      You have to use interfaces extensively in A3. Classes must define interfaces and variables must be typed using interfaces. I just saw one solution that forgot to define an \\xa0interface for the scanner bean. So watch out for this mistake.      I just uploaded a new unccheckstyle jar ( UNCChecks_6.5.0.jar &#xfffd;), which you need to   put in the dropins/plugins folder and\\xa0and a new A3 checks file ( Checks File ). Start eclipse again after you have downloaded them in the previous folders (you do not have to create a new A3 configuration). These should help uncover interface mistakes. Let me know if there is a problem with them - I have had only a few minutes to debug them.      Prasun  I opened it for another day because a student misread the deadline.\\xa0  Class,      I just uploaded a new version of it:\\xa0 Comp401LocalChecks.jar (Library)    It has an A3Suite.      As usual tests may be missing or give false positives and negatives, let us know of any errors.               When I print out the instance, does it need to be somewhat similar to what is on the assignment? I know it says it will vary but I want to make sure since mine is quite different ( main.Word&#64;330bedb4 ).     Class,      The packages are:   lectures.graphics   lectures.arrays      The quizzes are Graphics and Arrays LifeCycle      Most of you, especially those who have done Java before, can probably do most of the Arrays LifeCycle quiz without doing the praxis, though I recommend you do the part that involves use of the debugger.      The graphics part is conceptually very simple but new. I recommend you definitely do the praxis on it.      Together, they should take about an hour to do. You can use the other fifteen minutes to complete the ui praxis.      The discovery-based praxes are yet another means at your disposal to learn the material. Based on talking to you, I know some of you are using other means such as the \\xa0word docs,\\xa0ppt pdfs, ppt videos,, which is fine. Do what works best for you.\\xa0The reason we are working so hard on the praxes is that they probably help\\xa0you remember the material. Ultimately, the assignments will be the most effective method for \\xa0 retaining the information.  The question is:   Which is true:   \\xa0A.\\xa0An interface contains only headers of methods (the code between curly braces after a method header).   \\xa0B.\\xa0An interface contains both headers and bodies of methods.      The information inside the parenthesis is supposed to be part of option B not A, as it is describing what the body of a method is.\\xa0  Hi everyone,      We will probably go over this briefly tomorrow during recitation, but a couple notes about doing Assignment 3:      1. Be aware that it is possible to have empty interfaces (interfaces that do not specify any methods). As you would expect, you just don&#39;t put anything inside the curly braces.   \\xa0   *Edit: as you will see below, that point is not necessarily needed for this assignment.       2. You will need an interface for every class you have in the Assignment (except the &#34;Assignment3&#34; main class, I suppose), plus you will have a generic Token interface. All of your token classes will implement two interfaces (the generic and specific). For some of those token classes, the second interface they implement will be empty, since they don&#39;t have any special methods.       *Edit: I apologize, I totally misunderstood this part of the assignment. While you can have empty interfaces that are specific to each token, you do not need them. In addition, while every class will implement at least one interface, not every class will need to have an interface unique to itself. Corrected note below:      2. Every class you have in the Assignment (except for the &#34;Assignment3&#34; main class), will implement at least one interface. Most of them will just implement a generic token interface that you are required to create. Some of them (that have additional properties besides the input) will implement an additional, second interface. As a result, every public method your classes have will also be in some interface.      3. None of your  variables  should be of a specific class type (besides the classes you didn&#39;t create, like Scanner and String). They will instead be of an interface type.      The difference is this:      //Box is an interface, GiftBox is a class   Box myBox = new GiftBox() //Do this, because myBox is of an interface type   GiftBox myBox = new GiftBox() //Don&#39;t do this, because myBox is of a class type      4. In some cases, you might want to access the methods of an object even though the variable that points to it is of a type that doesn&#39;t have those methods. For example, GiftBox may implement both the Box and the Gift interface. (&#34;public class GiftBox implements Box, Gift&#34;). Say you have, as before:      Box myBox = new GiftBox();      You can do things like:   myBox.flatten();   myBox.doAnotherBoxThing()      But what if you want to do something else that GiftBox can do, such as .unwrap(), which comes from the Gift interface? Box does not have a .unwrap() method, so myBox.unwrap() will result in an error. However, we can tell Java that myBox is a Gift using &#34;(Gift)myBox&#34;. So we can do:      ((Gift)myBox).unwrap();      You could have also done &#34;((GiftBox)myBox).unwrap()&#34;, but we just said that we have to work with interfaces, so don&#39;t do that.  Class,      For local checks to work, there are constraints on where you call new Scanner (System.in) and how many times you call it.      1. It should be called a single time.   2. It should be called after main is called.      So if you are not doing a recursive processInput, declare the Scanner variable in processInput before the loop is called as in:      static void processInput() {   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Scanner scanner = new Scanner (System.in);   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0//loop   }      If you are doing a recursive processInput, you cannot use the solution above as each call will create a new instance of Scanner. So in this case make it a static variable but iniitalize it in main() as in:      static Scanner scanner;   public static void main(String[] args) {   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0scanner = new Scanner (System.in);   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0// rest of main   }      This is only for local runtime checks\\xa0to work. Our grader will simulate your environment, so you will not\\xa0lose points for not following these constraints as long as you\\xa0are sure about your code.      Prasun        In completing my recitation assignment, I have run into a null pointer exception in line 6 of the Driver class, &#34; ObjectEditor.edit(filter);&#34; (I know we aren&#39;t usually supposed to post code segments in here, but this code was given.) Additionally, the console says &#34;No factory registered for Bean Pattern&#34;.\\xa0      I really have no idea how to resolve this error, as I believe my code should execute properly, and I am not sure how to resolve this runtime error.      Thanks  Someone pointed out to me today that in Assignment 2, the scanString method and IndexOf method were supposed to be in the Bean class and were to be implemented there. \\xa0How I set up my program, I had processInput (from the main class (&#34;Assignment2&#34;) call the setter in the Bean class, which would then set the values by calling back to the main class where scanString and indexOf were located.      My question is how much credit would I lose for this mistake, because I can correct it and resubmit my program by the end of today at a late penalty of 10%. \\xa0 Would this mistake be worth more than 10%?  I thought the Interface quiz was due tonight. Is there anyway it can be reopened or get partial quiz? I had most of it done.  &#34;If you have been doing extra credit so far and think you will have time for it at the end of the semester also, create token classes for also the commands: “RotateLeftArm”, “RotateRightArm”, “Define”, “Call”, “Thread”, “Wait”, “ProceedAll”, “Sleep”, “Undo”, and “Redo”. You will receive a little extra credit for these token classes in this assignment, and additional points later for features that depend on them&#34;      Should these classes extend our Word class just as the required classes for this assignment do?  I have completed the coding for Assignment 3, and it works how it should.

Remember you have to change the assignment name in the suite you use.      These are not complete and may give false positives or negatives. Do look at the console output for each test and see if it makes sense and let me know of any problems.      Hope they help      Prasun    Is assignment 3 ready for us to begin?  Class,      The package is:\\xa0lectures.interfaces   Quiz: Interfaces      The praxes are timed (based on TA times) so that a 1 hour 15-minute lecture is supplemented with a \\xa045 min-1 hour praxis, giving us about 40 minutes each week for class discussion. Of course, some of you will take more time than this,so you may need to work outside class to finish them.      To help you go faster, I have tried to reduce the width of text in the praxes so you can have the left half the screen devoted to Eclipse and the right half to Sakai.      The assignments after A1 are both much harder and easier than A1. They are easier as you do not have to define complex loops. All you have do is apply a &#34;formula&#34; covered in the lecture material through examples and explanations. They are much harder as you cannot simply use your knowledge of Java (and/or the web) and your wits to solve the problem. You have to know the material. This is why time spent\\xa0on the praxes/quizzes is a stitch in time and worth it, in my opinion.\\xa0      By default, Sakai does not publish feedback and I may forget to override default settings. So let know if that is the case. I just edited the constructors feedback settings.      Also, the quiz is due a week after the praxis is assigned in class - please be mindful of this.      Prasun  Will I still get partial credit?  Is it extra credit if we turn in the Assignments a day early? I&#39;m unable to submit it on Sakai, seems that the &#34;assignment 2&#34; part is replaced by &#34;recitation 3&#34; , can someone tell me what to do? the for loop within my scanString function parses numbers fine, but prints words and quoted strings infinitely,   ex.   1 2 3 4   prints   numbers: 1   numbers: 2   numbers: 3   numbers: 4   while\\xa0   &#34;word&#34;   prints   quoted string: word   quoted string: word   quoted string: word      quoted string: word   and so on.      is the problem in the how the loop itself operates or how the words/quotes are being parsed?  How many total classes will Assignment 2 have? I know it will have a Bean class. I&#39;m not sure if you wanted a Driver class for the main method?  Is MultipleQuoteOutputTest[20.0 pts] and MissingQuoteOutputTest[5.0 pts] on localchecks extra credit?  I&#39;ve tried putting the breakpoints in different positions and restarting eclipse but I still cant figure out why I cant step into / over anything, it either just goes ahead and prints everything or doesn&#39;t do anything at all.  if the string &#34;JJJ&#34; &#34;Sea World Gull&#34; is entered.   what output do you want?      word: JJJ   word: Sea World Gull      ------- or --------      word: JJJ   word: Sea   word: World   word: Gull     I understood and completed Part 1 perfectly fine, but I can&#39;t wrap my head around how the Bean class works.\\xa0Do we simply move the scanning methods\\xa0to the Bean class and use the Bean class to scan and print the input lines read by the main class?\\xa0Or do we incorporate the Bean class into the scanning method that remains in ScanningIterator?         (Different person): Also, what are the roles of each class? \\xa0Is the Bean class only supposed to get and set the ScannedString, or does it do more?  I have a quick question about how interfaces work as I am not sure I am understanding it correctly.       The use of an interface is to allow multiple classes to access methods from different classes?      Say you have class A and it has a lot of good methods that may need to be used again in other classes.      You also have to other classes called B and C that at some point may want to use methods from class A and you don&#39;t want to re-write the code so you can use an interface?      So you would say something along the lines of:      public class B implements A { \\t&#64;Override \\tpublic String methodOne() \\t\\t{ \\t\\t    //stuff \\t\\t} \\t \\t&#64;Override \\tpublic int methodTwo() \\t\\t{ \\t \\t    //stuff \\t\\t} }         Is this the correct way of thinking about interfaces?\\xa0 As a &#34;subclass&#34; of another class that allows it to use the other methods?  What does all of this mean?\\xa0 Are we supposed to know what all of this does now or is it just something we need to put down now and we will find out what it means later?   import util.annotations.Tags; import util.annotations.StructurePattern; import util.annotations.StructurePatternNames; import util.annotations.EditablePropertyNames; import util.annotations.PropertyNames;  &#64;Tags({&#34;Word&#34;}) &#64;StructurePattern(StructurePatternNames.BEAN_PATTERN) &#64;PropertyNames({&#34;Input&#34;,&#34;Value&#34;}) &#64;EditablePropertyNames({&#34;Input&#34;})     I only took screen shots of me using the breakpoints, and step into for debugging, and did not realise we needed to show step over and step return as well. Can I add screen shots to my assignment? Also I added a couple screen shots of my code itself but am not sure if that was necessary.  Class,      I have finally uploaded a version that is somewhat debugged. Aa always create a new configuration.      Prasun  Can I ask a not-so-relevant question?   Does Java pass values in methods&#39; arguments by reference or by value?   Here&#39;s what I learned by testing and searching online. Everything in Java is a &#34;pointer&#34; (or acts like a pointer, anyway) and thus passes by value. Is this correct? And if I want to pass by reference, what can I do?   By the way I used to code in C&#43;&#43; and am not very familiar with Java.   If I wanna get deeper in Java study, is there any recommendation on textbooks?   Thanks.  Whenever I click on one of the links to PDF&#39;s or Powerpoint&#39;s of the past two class lectures or any of the files on the course website, I get a 404 Not Found error.\\xa0 These links have worked for me the past couple of days.\\xa0 Any ideas on how to fix this?  Class,      Here is the info. Please let me know if there are issues - these have not been tested by the TAs but I wanted to get you this info asap.

Class,      As I have mentioned several times, discussion is part of your class participation grade and you are responsible for filling the Sakai\\xa0discussion &#34;quiz&#34; to identify all instances in which you participated\\xa0constructively in the discussion.      Here are the discussion questions for tomorrow. In future, the package-info will also contain the discussion questions:      * DISCUSSION INFO * What did you learn or re-learn in through this praxis and the questions? * What is the purpose of a package? * What is the purpose of an import? * What is the purpose of putting constraints on the header of any method? * What is the purpose of a main method, that is, why distinguish main from other methods? * What is the purpose of the argument to the main method? * What is the practical benefit of modularity in {&#64;link lectures.scanning.AModularConsoleReadingUpperCasePrinter}? * How can we improve the modularity of {&#64;link lectures.scanning.AModularConsoleReadingUpperCasePrinter}?        I&#39;m working on Assignment 1, and I can&#39;t seem to find a way around a major problem. \\xa0I&#39;ve set up the scanner for my assignment file, but it won&#39;t separate the numbers to be used as tokens. \\xa0For example, If I input &#34;2 3 0100&#34; the scanner returns &#34;230100&#34;. \\xa0COULD SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME WHAT I&#39;M DOING WRONG?!

If you have merge problems, reset (in case you made no notes, which you will lose)   if that also does not work, just import from scratch into a new directory.      if you have time, look at the lecture on this subject before class, as many of the concepts will be new to you.      We will,\\xa0of course, have a discussion of the last praxis at the start of the class. After that those who have not submitted the scanning quiz should do so before the deadline      Prasun  Class,      I have uploaded a new version of assignment to make some clarifications/corrections based on the questions I have had today:      The links in the assignment were not working on one student&#39;s computer. \\xa0I recopied them and they work on mine.      Even though the scanner can be implemented without the suggested three methods, we do require them - you will lose style points if you do not implement them.      The order in which the three methods should be implemented has been given.      The term &#34;passing a string&#34; has been clarified.      Prasun        Since we&#39;ll be doing more praxes in the coming future, it is worth mentioning what you should try to get out of them. The hope with praxes is twofold: that by the time we discuss a concept, you have enough investment, questions, or background to learn it in a way that gives it context (since you have seen the concepts in code yourselves); and that you learn it in a hands-on and cooperation-oriented approach that makes it stick.      With that in mind, remember that a lack of certainty is a natural part of the process, and that you are not expected to master the concept from the praxis alone. When you come across a concept you are unsure about, experiment with the code, TALK to people around you, form hypotheses, write down and ask questions in the discussion that follows, and look into the detailed explanations of concepts given online. The idea is that once you do gain an understanding of a concept, it will be a more grounded one, spurred by experience and necessity.      So explore, be inquisitive, and don&#39;t be afraid to not know everything! Turn your uncertainty into a tool of learning by asking questions and experimenting.  Class,      Assignment 2 is up - I have not had a chance to proof it, so please point out mistakes you find as replies to this post.      I have also put a checks file, which may also have mistakes you should identtify.

Hello Everyone,   I am a former Student of Dr. Dewan that took 401 Fall of last year. I will be offering free tutoring for the class in room SN047 from 6-7:30PM on Monday and Wednesday. This hopefully gives you another avenue for help if you are unable to make other office hours. I am also available by email at\\xa0 sdgeorge&#64;email.unc.edu \\xa0if you would like to email me questions or let me know you intend to come to these hours. I am also flexible on evening hours if you have a time after 6 and day that works better for you. I will also be posting responses to try and help on piazza.      Note: These will start next Monday unless someone emails today  Are we writing one big public class to execute the instructions outlined in part one and then in part two, we&#39;re simply making a bean class that provides the material/properties for another class to modify to produce a desired output?  The instructions tell us to:   -Place and submit the screen captures in a folder -Not to put the screen captures in the project .zip file -Not to submit a second .zip file  However, I don&#39;t think we can actually upload &#34;folders&#34; to Sakai without zipping it to a single file first. What should we do?  I followed the instructions on the powerpoint ( http://www.cs.unc.edu/~dewan/comp401/current/Lectures/RuntimeLocalChecks.pdf) \\xa0but when I attempt to run the test, I receive an error message.

Is the link for the assignment 1 checks file on the website broken? It doesn&#39;t seem to be working for me.  Class,      Please make sure you have the JavaTeaching pulled and try and work as quickly as you can as we need both parts of the praxis, in the statics and instances subpackages, for assignment 2.      I have updated the import from git section to take care of the situation in which pull does not work. Just copy your changed files from the previous praxis to a folder (such as the desktop) in one click and reset and pull the project again. It is still possible you have problems, in which case you do need to reimport the project and set the class path.            ng\\xa0GitProject (JavaTeaching)        PowerPoint     PDF        I was skeptical at first, but this actually seems like a pretty neat tool. However, I&#39;m getting some issues. Whenever I run a check suite I pass the first test it attempts, but none of the subsequent tests. From the output it looks like it&#39;s correctly writing parameters to the console but only for the first several tests before it ends the program, starts it again, and passes the program nothing. Occasionally I&#39;ll get an error message, too. It looks like it stems from a NullPointerException occurring in the library. I&#39;m having some trouble reproducing it now.

However, earlier it  was  printing a stack trace. Still haven&#39;t been able to reproduce it.     Hi everyone,      This is a correction to the submission instructions that we (the TA&#39;s) gave during recitation.      The instructions for zipping your projects are still the same, and that zip file gets submitted as we had said. However, screenshots are NOT zipped together with the project. Instead, they are submitted as separate, additional files on Sakai.      Please do this from now on.      Thank you.  Class.      As \\xa0mentioned in the lecture, at least one of the answers to the latest quiz was wrong, which I have corrected.\\xa0      Also, I have changed the due dates of the Attendance and Discussion &#34;quizzes&#34; . See if you can submit multiple times to it.      Prasun  Class,      I need to take \\xa0extra steps to update it after I make changes to JavatTeaching.      I have just taken those steps - they seem to work, so in the resources sections, they should be available in the last column (under packages) as in:\\xa0    lectures.scanning\\xa0Package       I just noticed that the link from class dual roles is pointing to the wrong package. \\xa0Will try to fix it later.      PS: The following link contains all of the code:\\xa0 JavaToHTML       Prasun  If indexOf() and indexOfNot() are methods of ScanningIterator, their first argument, String s, is not needed since the input string is a member variable of ScanningIterator. The constructor of ScanningIterator initializes it. But the assignment asks indexOf() to have three arguments.\\xa0      Should we create ScanningIterator that implements Iterator&lt;Character&gt; rather than Iterator&lt;String&gt;?      If we indeed need to create ScanningIterator that implements Iterator&lt;String&gt;, I guess we should have a main class, say Scanning that implements Iterable&lt;Integer&gt;. So we assume a user gives a String array, each of which is like &#34;20\\xa0\\xa030 0100&#34;. Scanning takes the String array. We use ScanningIterator to process each of them and print out results on the console. Also the processInput() and scanString() don&#39;t need to be static.  is on the web:       lectures.class_dual_roles.statics\\xa0Package     lectures.class_dual_roles.instances\\xa0Package    \\xa0   remember to do statics before instances.  My Mac won&#39;t recognize the UNCChecks_6.5.0 file from the class website and whenever I try to access it, Eclipse tells me the file isn&#39;t available. I&#39;ve tried moving it to locations other than the plugins and dropins but it gives me the same error message. Does anyone have advice or suggestions?            Many of you thought it was due at midnight, so I have given you a few more days to finish it in case you do not see this message today.  Class,      First,\\xa0when I said &#34;private&#34; is banned and will make sense when we study inheritance, I really meant &#34;protected&#34;. I did have some exercises involving private, but I have removed them as there is no quiz question on it, and this praxis is enough work without it. If you played around with private - that is great.      Based on all of the issues I saw, I have modified the praxes to help you answer the questions more directly. Before or right after each exercise, I have put the relevant question as some of you had difficulty seeing the connections. Make sure no comment is collapsed - I believe the comment on imports was in some cases.      If you have been able to answer the questions with the original praxes and web searches, good. Otherwise pull or reset and pull again before tuesday ideally.      As the assignment is due tomorrow, many of you were more concerned about the assignment rather than the praxis for the next assignment. I am not sure how to handle that, will discuss in class.      The web links have also been updated, but some of text in the comments is mangled in the translation.\\xa0      You are expected to get all of the quiz questions in discussions involving your partners and us. So if something is not apparent from the praxis, please let me let us \\xa0know immediately - the three of us were idle much of the class time. Do not feel shy!      Prasun        Class,      LocalChecks calls your main multiple times, once for each input it tests. So if you call System.exit(), the local checks UI will terminate after the first test, and you will not see the output.      In later assignments, the TAs&#39; grader will also call some of your methods directly. So if you call System.exit() the entire grading session for all students will terminate.      So please do not call System.exit() in your programs, just call return.      If you have already submitted the program, do not worry, our grading of A1 will not be affected. But if your localchecks window is not giving you the test output, this is the reason.      Prasun              i successfully installed Local checks on my computer. However, every time I try to run it, the program will freeze without giving me any output. What should I do to make the program to work?  When I ran Local Checks, I always got &#34;correct output but errors&#34;. What does that mean?\\xa0  What is Invalid Character Suite in Local Checks? Do we have to pass it to get the whole assignment correct \\xa0( without doing extra credit Error Recovery)? Cuz it seems that the computer&#39;s input contains letters which are assumed not to be in user input.\\xa0  In the Assignment 2 document, it says to add:   import util.annotations.EditablePropertyNames; import util.annotations.PropertyNames; import util.annotations.StructurePattern; import util.annotations.StructurePatternNames; import util.annotations.Tags;   But for each of these I get: \\xa0&#34;The import util cannot be resolved&#34; from eclipse      EDIT: \\xa0I thought I had associated oeall22.jar with the project but I had apparently not. \\xa0This fixed it.  Class,      Based on two incorrect projects I have seen, here are some mistakes you might have made. Except for 1 and 6, you will get more points if you correct them with a late submission.  I will add to this list if I see more problems.       1. Comparing the entire line with &#34;.&#34; using equals() (which I did not mention in the assignment), instead of comparing \\xa0the first character with &#39;.&#39;.      2. Parsing the terminating line into an integer , thereby throwing an exception.      3. Continuing to ask for input even after the terminating line has been recognized and not parsed.      4. Not implementing your indexOf() function.      5. Using\\xa0the \\xa0banned predefined indexOf() function of String.      6. Printing the number (200) rather than the token (0200)      Also,\\xa0to make localchecks work, you should execute “ new Scanner(System.in)” once. This means it should be executed outside the input reading loop. You will not lose points for not meeting this requirement, but you may want to change your code and run localchecks\\xa0to catch errors.        Class,      Visit class page:\\xa0 http://www.cs.unc.edu/~dewan/comp401/current/ \\xa0and overview it.      Install Java, Eclipse, and read the tutorial on Git and pull JavaTeaching (Importing\\xa0GitProject (JavaTeaching) )       If you are not in the correct recitation please contact:\\xa0Jodie Gregoritsch &lt;jogregor&#64;cs.unc.edu&gt;      If you are unsure about having enough background, start the first assignment asap and see if you know how to do it. Go to the section on Scanning.      If you do not know Java, look at the section on Relevant Java\\xa0Syntax. You will face some teething problems, which you should overcome in a couple of weeks.      I will post today&#39;s lecture as soon as the video is made.      Prasun              Is on the web (Also I edited my previous post a bit to identify the git section)  after downloading the eclipse installer from the website I am faced with a bunch of different options to install. I assume they are all different from each other in small ways but which tool do we need for this class? I&#39;m thinking its the first option, but I want to ask to make sure...   Where can I find the instructions on completing the first coding assignment?\\xa0 Is it posted yet?         Thank You  Is there a specific name that is needed for the first assignment?  Class,      We have updated the slides for JavaTeaching to\\xa0address these errors. See slides 10-14.      Prasun        I followed all of the instructions on Checkstyle PDF twice (the second time on a clean Eclipse install) but I don&#39;t seem to be getting the option to use the UNC Checkstyle configuration.    After completing the process both times, all I have access to are the default Google and Sun Checkstyle configs. Any ideas what I should do?  I&#39;m having trouble getting the CheckStyle software to work. It says &#39;no software site found&#39;. Anyone know what&#39;s going on?         Are we permitted to use Arraylists on this first assignment? Specifically for the scanString() method we have to implement.        I tried to download the jar files ObjectEditor and Checkstyle. After finishing downloading, I tried to open them and it said that they could not be launched. I have the latest versions of Java downloaded. What should I do?  Are we to assume that the user will only enter in numbers as potential tokens? If so, why is using the Character.isDigit() function necessary?  Class,      Look at the following for today&#39;s in-class activities. We will have some teething problems with software installation - maybe those of you who successfully downloaded can help the others. Only half the original class has enrolled in Piazza s far, not sure what that implies, but am worried ...           Lecture Structure        PowerPoint     PDF        I have a completed working version of Assignment 1 and I get a checkstyle violation for importing java.util.scanner (illegalTypeImported: (Assignment1.java:2) Used disallowed class java.util.Scanner). \\xa0In the assignment document it says we are expected to use Scanner.nextLine(). \\xa0Should I disregard this violation?     Did anyone else encounter this problem when trying to extract the eclipse files you downloaded?         Are we allowed to use StringTokenizer to break up the string?\\xa0 Or should we use parsing?  Class,      I have uploaded \\xa0new version of\\xa0UNCChecks_6.5.0.jar .      if you have successfully installed checkstyle, \\xa0close eclipse and overwrite the \\xa0previous version of this file with the new version and then restart Eclipse. Also look carefully at slides: 19-37. A lot has changed, so this is really important.      if you have not successfully installed checkstyle, look at the whole slide deck.\\xa0      Semion has confirmed that Checkstyle installs correctly Neon on Windows.      The pdf of slides of course are in:\\xa0 http://www.cs.unc.edu/~dewan/comp401/current/Lectures/UNCCheckStyle.pdf       Checkstyle is not essential to doing your project so do not spend too much on the installation and use of it. But if it installs quickly it is probably useful for some.      In the next recitation, we might go through itsinstallation.      Prasun  Is it necessary that we create an indexOfNot() method if we can accomplish the variable spaces extra credit without it? Since indexOf() function will give us the position of spaces/numbers, next step is to get number by components, are we allowed to use string slice in this process?  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sloved, thanks! I am ready to submit my assignment 1 and I just wanted to make sure I was submitting it correctly. \\xa0The assignment document said not to include the screenshots in the .zip archive so I am uploading 3 files - Assignment1.zip, which contains the entire project directory, as well as one screenshot showing basic functionality and one showing extra credit functionality. \\xa0Is this the right way to do it?  Piazza is a Q&A platform designed to get you great answers from classmates and instructors fast. We've put together this list of tips you might find handy as you get started:  1.   Ask questions!   The best way to get answers is to ask questions! Ask questions on Piazza rather than emailing your teaching staff so everyone can benefit from the response (and so you can get answers from classmates who are up as late as you are).  2.   Edit questions and answers wiki-style.   Think of Piazza as a Q&A wiki for your class. Every question has just a single  students' answer  that students can edit collectively (and a single  instructors’ answer  for instructors).  3.   Add a followup to comment or ask further questions.   To comment on or ask further questions about a post, start a  followup discussion . Mark it resolved when the issue has been addressed, and add any relevant information back into the Q&A above.  4.   Go anonymous.   Shy? No problem. You can always opt to post or edit anonymously.  5.   Tag your posts.   It's far more convenient to find all posts about your Homework 3 or Midterm 1 when the posts are tagged. Type a “#” before a key word to tag. Click a blue tag in a post or the question feed to filter for all posts that share that tag.  6.   Format code and equations.   Adding a code snippet? Click the  pre  or  tt  button in the question editor to add pre-formatted or inline teletype text.  Mathematical equation? Click the  Fx  button to access the LaTeX editor to build a nicely formatted equation.  7.   View and download class details and resources.   Click the  Course Page  button in your top bar to access the class syllabus, staff contact information, office hours details, and course resources—all in one place!   Contact the Piazza Team anytime with questions or comments at  team@piazza.com . We love feedback!\""
